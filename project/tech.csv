Dodgers doctor revealed reason for Mookie Betts' Tokyo Series exit

Mookie Betts has been struggling with bad health, which also led him to miss out on being a part of the Los Angeles Dodgers roster for the Tokyo Series. Even though the Dodgers won the series, fans definitely missed watching Betts show his magic on the field.On Sunday, Mookie Betts was interviewed by reporters in Los Angeles to talk about his health status. Betts hinted at a positive health status, claiming that his ""body feels great"" compared to how it was feeling last week. Talking about the improvements he has noticed, Betts said:""I mean, I feel great. Like, my body feels great. I've been able to work out. I've been able to do pretty much everything but eat, which is strange. So the symptoms have kind of gone away, I just have to figure out how to get my stomach to kind of calm down.""Moving forward in the interview, Mookie Betts also talked about his struggles with eating and the approach he plans on taking with his play after returning to the lineup. Opening up about his comeback plans, Betts explained:""It's just hard to fathom not eating and going to play a game. So it looks like I'm just going to be light for a little bit. Maybe I play uphill a little bit at the beginning of the season. But no, I just want to play, man. I'm tired of sitting, tired of throwing up, tired of doing all this. I really just want to play.""The LA Times interviewed Dodgers doctor Heal ElAttrache recently, during which he talked about the real reason behind Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman's exit from the Tokyo Series. Sharing details into the exact reason, ElAttrache said:""Dehydration is one of the worst conditions you can have for muscle strains. You have Mookie come out here, tear an oblique or hamstring; you can lose him for six weeks. This time of the year is the worst time to take a chance. If you're wrong and too aggressive with it … they lose six or eight weeks.""Before talking about his injury, Mookie Betts made headlines when he reflected back on his time with the Boston Red Sox and compared it with that of the Los Angeles Dodgers.","Mookie Betts has been struggling with bad health, which also led him to miss out on being a part of the Los Angeles Dodgers roster for the Tokyo Series.

Meghan Markle believed 2017 Vanity Fair cover was about her charity work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-this-going-to-all-be-about-prince-harry-meghan-markle-believed-2017-vanity-fair-cover-was-about-her-charity-work/articleshow/119450853.cms,"Vanity Fair ex-editor Graydon Carter revealed that Meghan Markle initially believed her 2017 magazine cover was earned for her charity work, rather than her relationship with Prince Harry.Speaking to Page Six, Carter, who ran the magazine from 1992 until his departure in 2017, recalled how the decision to feature Markle was made.“Jane Sarkin, who booked our covers, came in and said, ‘We should do a cover on Meghan Markle,” Carter said. “I said, ‘I have no idea what that is, why should we do a story on her?’”Sarkin then explained that Markle, who was already known for her role in Suits, was dating Prince Harry. “So she said, ‘Because she’s going to marry Prince Harry,’” Carter recalled.Once the cover was secured, Markle, now 43, reportedly challenged the journalist interviewing her. According to Carter, she asked, “Excuse me, is this going to all be about Prince Harry? Because I thought we were going to be talking about my charities and my philanthropy.”Carter added, “This woman is slightly adrift on the facts and reality.”Despite Markle’s hopes, the feature ultimately ran under the headline: “Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry!”Markle and Harry began dating in 2016, announced their engagement in 2017, and married a year later. However, in 2020, the couple stepped down from royal duties and relocated to the US.Reflecting on Prince Harry’s estrangement from his family, Carter speculated on how Princess Diana would have felt about the situation.“I would think she would feel great sorrow for her son to have been pulled away from his family like this, especially his brother but also his father,” he said. “Anytime someone comes between siblings that’s a disaster, horrible for a family.”Carter, who knew Diana personally, having met the Princess on several occasions, also shared her curiosity about how Jackie Kennedy was treated by the Kennedy family.“She was very intrigued and kept asking questions — she wanted to know how Jackie Kennedy was treated by the Kennedy family because, I think, she felt there were parallels between how Jackie was treated and the way she was treated by the royal family,” he said.","Graydon Carter, who ran Vanity Fair from 1992 until his departure in 2017, recalled how the decision to feature Meghan Markle was made.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Perplexity AI’s Desi CEO to Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on AI chatbots: ‘All are same but if used for…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-ais-desi-ceo-to-zerodha-co-founder-nikhil-kamath-on-ai-chatbots-all-are-same-but-if-used-for/articleshow/119498116.cms,"‘Perplexity differentiated itself by providing sources but…’: Srinivas

Perplexity AI ’s CEO Aravind Srinivas has said that despite the rapid advancements and intense competition in the generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) space, the core capabilities of leading chatbots currently lack significant distinction. However, speaking on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath 's podcast, he said that there is one area where people may pick the best.When asked how the Big Tech is doing things differently, Srinivas observed a striking similarity among the major players.“[The] honest answer right now is all of them are doing similar things. I'll just say it as blunt as it can be. There's not really a genuine differentiation between ChatGPT or Anthropic or Gemini or Grok or Meta AI right now and, of course, Perplexity. You can argue similarly,” he said, attributing this behaviour to the industry's focus on common evaluation metrics.“Currently, excluding the search part, most models give the same answers,” he explained.“This is because they are trying to climb on the same benchmarks, same leaderboards. There isn't a lot of qualitative difference,” he explained.While Perplexity initially differentiated itself by emphasizing accurate sourcing – a feature Srinivas notes competitors are now emulating – he suggested current user choice often boils down to specific task suitability.“In the beginning, the differentiation was we were the only ones to make sure you always had sources for everything – highly accurate sources, fast answers and so on but everybody else is also realising that the real values in search even more than free form chat. And they're trying to put sources for almost any response so I think right now we're in this weird phase where like all AI chatbots seem similar,” he added.However, the one area Srinivas pointed out that makes all chatbots different is fact checking and research.“If you use AI for fact checks and research, financial research etc, you would pick whichever model does that best,” he commented.Nevertheless, Srinivas predicts this landscape of similarity is poised for a shift. The crucial differentiator in the near future, he argued, will be the development of “agentic behaviour” – AI systems capable of performing tasks, not just generating text.“Answering questions will be seen as a commodity—just answering in text will not cut it,” Srinivas made a prediction for 2025. He believes future advancements will involve AI generating richer outputs like graphics and charts and, more significantly, actively “doing things” for the user.This evolution towards action-oriented AI, Srinivas noted, is dependent on sophisticated reasoning capabilities, which he believes are only just beginning to function successfully within AI systems.","Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, spoke on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's podcast.

Spotting shorter words first can make it easier to identify longer ones.

Think of legendary bands with decades-long careers and classic hits.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
