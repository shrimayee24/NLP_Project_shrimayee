IAF Workhorse MiG-21 Makes Last Sorties At Nal Ahead Of Sept 26 Chandigarh Farewell

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

“Them Miami H*es”: Antonio Brown ignites online firestorm with vulgar swipe at Tyreek Hill’s ex-wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/them-miami-hes-antonio-brown-ignites-online-firestorm-with-vulgar-swipe-at-tyreek-hills-ex-wife/articleshow/123540885.cms,"Tyreek Hill & Antonio Brown (Getty Images)

Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet

Tyreek Hill, Keeta Vaccaro, and the real financial stakes

The personal and financial fallout of Tyreek Hill’s short-lived marriage is making headlines, but it was Antonio Brown’s online commentary that sent the story viral. The Miami Dolphins wide receiver is reportedly facing steep divorce obligations to estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, and Brown wasted no time in weighing in with his trademark bluntness. What could have been just another celebrity divorce update quickly morphed into a cultural flashpoint about money, respect, and the realities of high-profile relationships.Sports insider Dov Kleiman reported that Hill could be forced to pay Vaccaro between $20,000 and $50,000 per month in “spending money,” along with a one-off “$500,000” check. Brown quote-posted the report with the line, “Them Miami Hoes Will Get You Everytime…”His phrasing immediately overshadowed the financial figures. Critics argued his comment was misogynistic, while others defended it as hard-edged honesty about the risks athletes face when wealth and love collide. Brown, already known for stirring controversy, once again positioned himself at the center of an NFL-adjacent debate.Beyond the viral soundbite, Hill’s legal situation is no joke. After only 15 months of marriage, the potential settlement figures reflect not just his multimillion-dollar earnings but also the lifestyle considerations courts often factor into support cases. One fan’s reply captured the financial angle perfectly: “When will guys learn the magical word… prenup…”It’s a reminder that behind every high-profile romance lies the practical question of asset protection. For Hill, who remains one of the league’s brightest stars, the financial toll could be significant both on and off the field.Also Read: “Taylor Swift fans in doggy”: Antonio Brown mocks Swifties with crude meme sparking online outrage The Brown-fueled uproar proves one thing: in today’s NFL, divorce drama doesn’t just play out in courtrooms — it’s fought on timelines, reshaped in memes, and debated by millions in real time.","Antonio Brown’s five-word post ignites the internet about Tyreek Hill.

Dana White faces unexpected robot move at UFC Shanghai demo goes viral

“robot-fu”

Unitree G1 humanoid robots gain attention after Shanghai fight show

A robot turned on UFC boss Dana White during a live demo in Shanghai on August 23, 2025. The robot, made by Chinese company Unitree, was meant to show a safe martial arts demo. Instead, one of its G1 humanoid models ignored the plan and confronted White. He ran away and was not hurt. The event made people talk online about how robots can be hard to control.Unitree, a robotics company from Zhejiang province, was showing off its G1 humanoid robots at a UFC event in Shanghai. The show was part of the UFC Shanghai fight weekend. Unitree had brought two G1 models to showor robot martial arts. In May, those same G1 robots had competed in the “Mecha Fighting Series” at the World Robot Competition in Hangzhou.The robots rise to about four feet tall, weigh around 35 kg (about 77 lb), and can move fast with good balance. People were curious to see them strike and move like humans.During the demo, one of the robots did not follow the planned moves. It moved toward Dana White instead of stepping back. White dodged away without getting hurt. He looked shaken but safe. The clip of that moment blew up online.Also Read: Syko Stu GoFundMe Fundraiser Crosses $50,000 Following Violent Raja Jackson Wrestling Attack The G1 robot from Unitree had already achieved fame in robot fighting events.Unitree hosted a live robo-fight competition called ""Iron Fist King"" at its Hangzhou factory in late May, where teams steered G1 robots in a circle. They demonstrated lightning-fast responses in real-time as well as powerful strikes and kicks.Unitree's G1 bots and other technology teams demonstrated humanoid robots boxing, knee strikes, and fluid movements as well at the 2025 Shanghai China World Artificial Intelligence Conference. The crowd was amazed by the robots' human-like speed.The viral Shanghai moment has now fueled global debates on robot safety, AI control, and whether unpredictable machines should be trusted in live sports shows, entertainment, or future public demonstrations.The UFC Shanghai mishap sparked Chinese media debates, with experts urging stronger AI safety protocols, stricter demo guidelines, and government oversight to prevent unpredictable robot actions during public performances.Many viewers joked about Dana White’s quick reflexes, while others worried such glitches could turn dangerous if left unchecked, making safety checks and human oversight even more important for future showcases.Some analysts now suggest that the viral scare could push regulators and tech companies to work closer together, setting new global standards on robot behavior before humanoids become common in sports entertainment.The Shanghai scare highlighted just how unpredictable advanced machines can be, raising fresh questions about trust, accountability, and whether audiences are truly ready for robots sharing space in live sporting environments.The incident has also sparked curiosity about future UFC collaborations with tech firms, where spectacle meets innovation, but safety concerns will likely shape how far these experiments in entertainment can actually go.This bizarre twist left people wondering if UFC shows will lean more on spectacle or rethink tech partnerships, as fans question whether thrills are worth the risks of unpredictable machines.Unitree, now eyeing an IPO, may rethink public stunts after the Shanghai incident. This episode underscores that even demo robots need trust, precision, and safeguards before stepping into the spotlight.","Robot turned on UFC boss Dana White during a live demo in Shanghai on August 23, 2025.

Rovers have the new Wuthering Waves update 2.6 which includes two powerful Sonata Effects. These are the Law of Harmony and the Crown of Valor. Augusta and Iuno are two newly released five-star characters, and these two 3-piece sets are the best in the slot to significantly boost combat efficiency. However, getting these sets requires farming in the most challenging zones of the game. Here’s a complete guide on how to get them and why they’re important.In Wuthering Waves, Sonata Effects are crucial endgame gear as they greatly improve a Resonator’s functionality through specific and powerful buffs. Whereas other gear might offer generic stat increases, Sonata Effects provide specialised combat enhancements, which in turn, determine the success or failure of a team in high-level challenges. Given Augusta’s shield-based kit and Iuno’s damage output, the new sets are perfect for fully leveraging each character’s power spikes.The Crown of Valor Sonata Effect is a 3-piece set, with the other two pieces being Martial Artist’s Tassel and the Valor Echo. The Halo Sonata has the following effects:This is because, at the maximum stacks, the user gets a 30% ATK boost as well as a 20% Cri DMG bonus, quite an amazing synergy for characters that can consistently generate shields.This makes Crown of Valor the best set for Augusta and Iuno and equally efficient for Jianxi, who is also a shield-based Resonator.To get Crown of Valor Echo, one must clear Wastelands Nightmare Nest, which is southwest of Rustblood Pass. It also gives you 20 astrites for the first clear as a bonus, which encourages you to clear it promptly.Next is a Law of Harmony Sonata Effect, a resonator effect designed especially for skill-based playstyles, which is detailed below:This set is particularly convenient for Phrolova, who relies on Echo Skill damage scaling, but it can also be a versatile choice for other DPS-focused resonators.Farming Location Investing in the Echoes connected to the Law of Harmony leads players to the Nightmare Nest, located southwest of the Tetragon Temple. This makes the area popular among those aiming to perfect a skill-based team setup.The emergence of the Crown of Valor and the Law of Harmony sets signals a notable change in Wuthering Waves' gear system. These sets are designed to work with the new 5-star Resonators that have been released. They also unlock new, strong build strategies for the set's legacy heroes.",Wuthering Waves update 2.6 includes two powerful Sonata Effects.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shares 5 ChatGPT prompts he swears by for daily work that show what’s now possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-shares-5-chatgpt-prompts-he-swears-by-for-daily-work-that-show-whats-now-possible/articleshow/123559941.cms,"Satya Nadella’s 5 ChatGPT prompts for daily workflow

1. Predict key discussion points for meetings



2. Draft comprehensive project updates



3. Assess product launch readiness



4. Categorize time and focus areas



5. Prepare for specific meetings

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals. This allows him to walk into meetings with a sharper focus and often a step ahead of the conversation.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports. By leveraging GPT-5 for project updates, Nadella ensures faster, more accurate reporting while freeing time for higher-level strategic thinking.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines. These prompts illustrate how AI is moving from a supportive tool to a central decision-making partner in modern leadership.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities. By identifying time sinks, GPT-5 ensures leaders avoid burnout and maximize efficiency. It also helps executives quickly see if their time matches organizational goals.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently. This proactive support reduces time spent digging through notes or inboxes. It ensures that meetings are focused, productive, and strategically aligned. These prompts demonstrate how AI can transform executive workflows, making decision-making faster, smarter, and more data-driven.Nadella’s use of GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot reflects a broader trend toward AI-powered workflows. By automating routine tasks, analyzing complex data, and generating actionable insights, AI can save time, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. Many companies are now exploring similar AI-driven integrations to streamline workflows and boost productivity across multiple levels of their organizations. As organizations continue to integrate tools like GPT-5, executives and teams alike can leverage AI to focus on higher-value work while staying informed, organized, and proactive. This approach also fosters a culture of data-driven decision-making, empowering employees to take informed actions quickly. Additionally, it helps bridge communication gaps between departments by providing shared insights and context in real time.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, has become an essential part of his daily workflow.

Apple Hebbal & Koregaon Park Stores to Open This September

Teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rocket science for Wall Street , leaving SpaceX to join billionaire Ken Griffin 's Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer at just 16 years old. The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Kairan Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers. ""I had a very broad scope and a lot of responsibility, especially for a junior engineer,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.The Bangladeshi-American teenager will live within walking distance of Citadel Securities' Manhattan office, eliminating his previous need for his mother to drive him to work in Washington state. His mother's background as an investment banker provided early exposure to finance, making the transition feel natural despite his engineering roots, the report said.","Kairan Quazi, 16, is leaving SpaceX to join Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer.

AGs say lessons have been from social media



Realme P4 Launched: India’s Slimmest 7000mAh Battery Phone

A group of top lawyers in the US has issued an open letter to technology companies, including Google , Microsoft, ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, among others, warning them to keep children safe from AI chatbots, or face severe legal consequences. The letter, sent by 44 state attorneys general from across the US and its territories this week, said, “Don’t hurt kids. That is an easy bright line.”Out of the Silicon Valley's leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies, the group singled out Meta for harsh criticism. The letter essentially blasted the tech titan following leaked documents that reportedly revealed the company had approved AI assistants capable of “flirt[ing] and engag[ing] in romantic roleplay with children” as young as eight.“We are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children’s emotional well-being,” the attorneys general wrote. A Meta spokesperson previously said that the company strictly bans content that sexualises children.Meta was not the only company targeted. The AGs also cited allegations that Google’s AI chatbot encouraged a teenager to commit suicide and that a Character.ai bot suggested a boy kill his parents.Google, in response, clarified that its search engine and Character.ai are entirely separate and unrelated companies, and that Google has never been involved in designing or managing Character.ai's AI model or technologies. Recently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT also reportedly aided a 16-year-old teen into committing suicide.The attorneys general drew stark comparisons to the early days of social media, accusing Big Tech of ignoring early red flags while children became ""collateral damage.""“Broken lives and broken families are an irrelevant blip on engagement metrics,” the officials wrote, making it clear that government bodies ""won’t be caught flat-footed again. Lesson learned.""“Today’s children will grow up and grow old in the shadow of your choices,” the letter said, demanding that companies treat children as children, not merely as consumers, urging them to “See them through the eyes of a parent, not the eyes of a predator.”",44 state attorneys general from across the US and its territories this week sent an open letter to technology companies.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

South Korea Phone Ban: ‘No more phones in classrooms’ South Korea announces nationwide ban; to be implemented in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-more-phones-in-classrooms-south-korea-announces-nationwide-ban-to-be-implemented-in-2026/articleshow/123542944.cms,".

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Japan has adopted a high-tech approach to disaster preparedness by releasing an AI-generated video simulating a Mount Fuji eruption. The video provides Tokyo residents with a realistic visualisation of the potential hazards of the iconic volcano, a symbol of both natural beauty and danger, were it to erupt. It illustrates plumes of smoke, volcanic ash, and pyroclastic flows rapidly spreading toward Tokyo, highlighting risks to health, transportation networks, power supply, logistics, and daily urban life. While there is no imminent threat, Mount Fuji remains an active volcano, last erupting during the Hoei eruption 318 years ago. The simulation aims to enhance public awareness, encourage detailed emergency planning, strengthen disaster readiness, and ensure residents are better prepared for volcanic hazards and complex urban disaster scenarios.The AI simulation depicts Mount Fuji emitting massive plumes of smoke and ash, which quickly travel toward Tokyo. Streets, buildings, and vehicles are shown covered in volcanic ash, and the sky is darkened, highlighting the serious health, transportation, and logistical hazards that could follow a major eruption.Though there is no indication of an imminent eruption, scientists stress that Mount Fuji is an active volcano.Its last eruption, the Hoei eruption, occurred 318 years ago, and the volcano remains closely monitored for geological activity.The video aims to help residents visualize emergency scenarios, an important step in enhancing disaster preparedness for Japan’s capital, home to over 20 million people.The Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Disaster Prevention Division produced the video, showing the moment a woman on a busy street receives an emergency alert on her phone about Mount Fuji’s eruption. The narration warns:“The moment may arrive without any warning.”The simulation illustrates how volcanic ash could reach Tokyo within two hours, potentially causing:Such visualisations aim to encourage residents to plan ahead, including assembling emergency kits and identifying safe evacuation routes.Japan sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Over the years, authorities have emphasized disaster readiness due to the constant risk of large-scale natural disasters.In January, the Japanese government warned of an 80% likelihood of a major earthquake along the Nankai Trough within 30 years, intensifying public concern. While seismologists debate the accuracy of such predictions, these warnings highlight the importance of continuous vigilance and preparedness.The AI video sparked a mix of fear and reflection among residents. Social media responses revealed concerns about transportation chaos and summer heat challenges during potential power outages. Users noted essentials like water, food, flashlights, and stoves as critical, but also acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining comfort and safety under extreme conditions.Some critics considered the warnings alarmist, arguing that dramatic simulations may deter tourism or create unnecessary panic. However, authorities maintain that visual, scenario-based warnings are essential to increase public awareness and emergency readiness.In addition to AI simulations, the Japanese government has issued official preparedness guidelines for residents living near Mount Fuji.Recommendations include maintaining:A large-scale eruption could generate an estimated 1.7 billion cubic meters (60 billion cubic feet) of volcanic ash, with around 490 million cubic meters accumulating on urban infrastructure.

Conclusion





Saudi Civil Defence will run a planned test of its emergency-warning systems on Monday, November 3, 2025. Mobile phones across the Kingdom will receive test alerts and fixed sirens will sound in selected areas of Riyadh (Diriyah, Al-Kharj, Al-Dilam), Tabuk (all governorates) and Makkah (Jeddah and Thuwal). The exercise begins at 1:00 PM and finishes after the siren at 1:15 PM.Get ready for a sound check! In a crucial move to ensure public safety and emergency preparedness, the General Directorate of Civil Defense is rolling out a comprehensive test of its fixed siren and early warning systems. This isn't a drill to ignore, it’s a major step to boost community awareness and ensure that residents know exactly how to react to official alerts during a real emergency.The goal is simple: to confirm the national alert systems are operating at peak efficiency and ready to notify millions of people instantly. By testing both mobile alerts and traditional sirens simultaneously, the Civil Defense is ensuring maximum coverage and reinforcing the readiness of the entire warning network across the Kingdom.This periodic testing isn't confined to one small area; it's a geographically significant exercise targeting some of the most populated regions in the Kingdom.The tests will utilize the National Early Warning Platform through the cellular broadcast service, sending specific advisory messages directly to mobile phones, alongside the wailing of the fixed sirens.The test focuses on key cities and surrounding governorates, ensuring that preparedness is a regional priority. The areas involved in this specific drill include:To effectively manage the logistics and ensure an accurate evaluation of the system, the Civil Defense has established a precise, three-phase testing timeline for the upcoming test. The sequence carefully ensures that the modern mobile broadcast alerts are thoroughly tested before the traditional siren network..If you are in one of the targeted regions, here is the exact schedule for what you can expect on the day of the test:These routine and comprehensive trials, using both cell broadcast technology and classic sirens, are the Civil Defense’s way of verifying the readiness and resilience of the system. The clear and simple schedule is specifically designed to keep residents fully informed, making the whole process easy to understand and ensuring that when a real emergency strikes, everyone knows exactly what to listen for and what to doAs Saudi Arabia continues strengthening its national emergency-response systems, Monday’s drill is a reminder that preparedness is a shared responsibility. Taking a moment to recognise the alert tones and understand how they work today could make a real difference in any future emergency. Once the test concludes, life carries on as usual, but with the public a little more informed, and the Kingdom a step safer.","Saudi Civil Defence will run a planned test of its emergency-warning systems on Monday, November 3, 2025.

The announcement and immediate action

Your responsibility

The takeaway





The days of waking up and frantically checking local news for a last-minute school cancellation are officially over. The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year, establishing clear, scientific benchmarks for when in-person studies must be suspended. This decisive policy removes all guesswork, ensuring that the health and safety of every student and teacher are prioritized the moment weather conditions become dangerous. Crucially, the order confirms that suspension (تعليق الدراسة) does not mean a holiday; it means an immediate, seamless pivot to remote learning, guaranteeing the educational process remains continuous.The Ministry of Education (and regional education directorates) set clear, limited situations when in-person schooling may be suspended. These decisions are not ad-hoc: they follow coordination with the National Meteorological Authority (or regional weather services) and Civil Defence, and they focus on actual risks to students’ and staff’s safety for example heavy rain/flooding, severe sandstorms, major infectious outbreaks, or national events that disrupt normal travel. Announcements are only official when released by the Ministry or the local education office.In a significant upgrade from previous policies, the Ministry now relies on specific, quantifiable metrics before authorizing a change in attendance. Regional education departments are expected to coordinate with weather services, automatically triggering a switch to remote learning when any of these nine conditions are met:While the new policy addresses unexpected weather disruptions, the Ministry has also confirmed the foundational academic schedule for the current year. Students should keep these dates locked in as they prepare for the first semester's official examinations:The seamless shift to remote learning, enabled by this new ministerial order, means that even severe weather events will not compromise the integrity or timing of these critical academic milestones.The notification process is designed to be fast and authoritative: The official announcement will come directly from the regional directorates of the Ministry of Education, often in coordination with the local Civil Defense authorities who monitor the weather. News is typically shared via official social media channels (like X/Twitter) and through local news outlets. Parents and students should also rely on official announcements from their individual schools. Once the suspension is announced, the school day is not cancelled; it is immediately converted into a remote learning day.Students are expected to be ready to transition instantly to digital learning to prevent any interruption in their studies. Students must immediately log onto their designated online learning platforms, such as Madrasati (مدرستي) or other approved digital tools used by their school. Just like in-person attendance, logging into the remote classes is mandatory. Teachers will take attendance, and students must follow the regular class schedule from home. The goal is to keep education flowing while ensuring safety. Students should treat the remote day with the same seriousness as a physical school day.This official ministerial order guarantees two things for the 1447 school year: students' safety is now backed by clear scientific data, and their education will never be truly interrupted. By standardizing these rules, Saudi Arabia has built a more stable and responsive system, ensuring that learning continues, rain or shine.","The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year.

UAE telecom operator Du jumps into bitcoin mining

What does Cloud Miner offer?

Step-by-step: Subscribing to Cloud Miner

Step 1: Get Ready to Bid the initial contracts are made available through an online auction hosted at the designated platform. You must be a UAE resident with a verified ID to participate.

Step 2: Participate in the Auction Bidding for the limited-capacity 24-month contracts runs for a specified period (The initial window was November 3 to 9). You will need to secure a contract through this process to gain access to the service.

Step 3: Account Verification (KYC/AML) To ensure regulatory compliance and security, du requires a strict verification process for all high-value transactions:

UAE Pass: Access to the platform requires verification through your official UAE Pass digital identity. This ensures adherence to local Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Mandatory 2FA is required for all account access, bolstering your security.

Step 4: Commence Mining Once your subscription is secured, your account is verified, and the fixed fees are paid, your cloud mining operation begins immediately from du's secure data centers in the UAE. You receive Bitcoin rewards based on the rented computational power.

What residents should weigh before signing up?

Costs vs rewards: Cloud mining reduces setup costs but fees, uptime, and pool efficiency affect returns read the fee and payout formulas closely.



Payout mechanics: Payouts are reported to be in Bitcoin and routed to users’ wallets ensure you have a compatible wallet and understand tax/reporting requirements in your emirate.

Contract terms & refunds: Check contract length, maintenance fees, and what happens if network difficulty rises or BTC price changes.

Security & trust: Using a large incumbent (du) gives more operational transparency than anonymous cloud-mining sites, but always verify service terms and regulatory disclosures.

Why is this interesting?





Want to mine Bitcoin without the drama of hardware, heat or high bills? UAE residents can now click, subscribe and start earning BTC - no tech skills needed. Du 's new Cloud Miner service, the UAE's first official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a telecom company, has made Bitcoin mining accessible and compliant for residents.This guide breaks down exactly what the service is, how to get started, and the key benefits of this regulated opportunity.MaaS stands for Mining as a Service. It's a business model that dramatically simplifies the process of cryptocurrency mining, particularly for digital assets like Bitcoin.In a MaaS model, a provider (like Du, with its Cloud Miner) owns and operates all the necessary, specialized mining hardware. They maintain the equipment, manage the high electricity consumption, and ensure the entire operation remains compliant and connected to the blockchain. Essentially, Cloud Miner allows UAE residents to participate in Bitcoin mining by simply subscribing to the output of a professional mining operation, making it an easy-to-digest investment product rather than a technical endeavor.The digital finance landscape in the UAE just got a major upgrade.Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner, offering residents a straightforward way to participate in the booming world of Bitcoin mining. Revealed on November 2, 2025, during a high-profile launch event at the Burj Khalifa, this service marks a massive first: it is the initial official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a UAE company.Cloud Miner is a “mining-as-a-service” product under du’s du Tech arm. Each contract sells a fixed amount of hashing power (plans start at 250 terahashes per second (TH/s)), and the mining results are paid out directly in Bitcoin to users’ crypto wallets. du runs the hardware, handles electricity and technical management, and shares the mined Bitcoin with subscribers according to the capacity they hold. This removes the need for users to buy ASIC rigs, arrange power, or manage complex cooling and maintenance.This move is exclusive to UAE residents and instantly expands the digital options available to those looking to grow their investment portfolio within a fully transparent and locally compliant framework. It aligns perfectly with the country’s push to develop robust digital asset and blockchain infrastructure.The initial phase of securing a Cloud Miner contract is done through a specific online process, designed for UAE residents only.A mainstream telecom company offering cloud mining services lowers the entry barrier for ordinary UAE residents and signals the UAE’s continued push to integrate digital-asset services into mainstream infrastructure, while also highlighting the need to strictly follow local rules about where mining can physically operate.","Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner.

Understanding Shingles

Two-Dose Shingrix schedule and coverage

Abu Dhabi Citizens: Eligible citizens holding a Thiqa card can receive the vaccine free of charge at authorized healthcare facilities.

Insured Residents: While not fully subsidized in all emirates, leading health insurers like Daman have recently expanded their coverage to include the Shingrix vaccine under their DHA Compliant Enhanced schemes, making it more accessible to residents with premium policies.





If you’re 50 or older in the UAE, there’s a new health reminder to add to your checklist: the shingles vaccine is now available to help protect you from the painful rash and nerve-related complications caused when the chickenpox virus resurfaces later in life.In a major step to strengthen public health, the UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) officially announced the inclusion of the Herpes Zoster vaccine—known commercially as Shingrix—into the national adult vaccination programme. This initiative ensures protection against the highly painful viral infection known as Shingles. The vaccine is now easily accessible at health facilities across all seven emirates. The primary target group for this vital preventive measure includes all UAE residents aged 50 years and older. However, those aged 18 and above who have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or therapy are also strongly advised to get vaccinated, reflecting a robust, proactive approach to health.Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the very same virus responsible for chickenpox.After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant within the nerve tissue and can reactivate years later, often as the immune system naturally weakens with age. The condition typically manifests as a painful skin rash and blisters that emerge on one side of the body. The pain is often described as burning or stabbing. Crucially, Shingles can lead to severe, long-lasting complications, most notably Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a form of chronic nerve pain that can persist for months or even years after the rash has cleared, significantly impacting the quality of life. The vaccine is recommended even for individuals who have previously experienced a Shingles outbreak.The Shingrix vaccine is administered as a two-dose series, maximizing its effectiveness. The second dose is typically scheduled to be received two to six months after the first. Health officials are dedicated to raising public awareness about the importance of adhering to this full two-dose schedule for maximum protection.Regarding cost, coverage varies by emirate and policy:The UAE’s nationwide shingles vaccination rollout reinforces the growing importance of adult immunisation as a core pillar of long-term public health. By proactively prioritising prevention for those most at risk, the country aims to significantly reduce severe cases and improve the overall quality of life for older adults. Individuals aged 50 and above are strongly encouraged to consult their healthcare provider and take timely vaccination to ensure complete and sustained protection.","UAE launches national adult vaccination drive for ages 50+.

Strengthening Dubai’s parking infrastructure









As Dubai’s commercial districts continue to expand, its streets are adapting. Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October. Clearly marked T-code areas now provide structured parking for workers, residents, and visitors in two of the city’s busiest business hubs.Parkin confirmed the introduction of two new paid parking zones under the T-code system — Zone Code 675T in Dubai Studio City and Zone Code 812T in Dubai Outsource City. Clear signboards have been installed throughout both locations to identify the designated areas.Paid parking operates daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the following tariff structure:These rates align with Parkin’s broader T-code pricing framework applied in several of Dubai’s newly developed areas.Residents and professionals working in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City can also access Parkin’s subscription plans, designed for regular or long-term parking users. The subscription packages are priced as follows:These options provide cost savings and convenience for individuals who park frequently within these zones, particularly those employed in the area’s media, technology, and outsourcing sectors.The addition of the new T-code zones follows a series of expansions undertaken by Parkin throughout 2024. In August, new paid parking zones were introduced in Al Jaddaf, with Zone 326C (on-street) and Zone 326D (off-street) implementing variable charges that differ between peak and non-peak hours.During the same period, Parkin brought 2,100 parking spaces across 59 mosques in Dubai under its management. Worshippers are entitled to one hour of free parking during prayer times, while standard paid parking applies outside those hours.Earlier in the year, the operator introduced additional zones in Mirdif, which remain free on Sundays and public holidays and feature variable fees based on demand. A new parking zone was also announced in Al Khail Gate in July, further broadening Parkin’s reach across the emirate.Parkin’s latest expansion underscores its central role in shaping Dubai’s public parking infrastructure. By extending managed parking to fast-growing commercial areas such as Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, the company continues to support urban development with organised, technology-driven parking solutions.As Dubai’s population and business activity expand, these additions reflect a consistent strategy: extending accessibility, ensuring clarity through signposted zones, and offering flexible options for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.","Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October.

"​AI-driven experiences will soon be a business necessity, says Ankur Tiwari",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ai-driven-experiences-will-soon-be-a-business-necessity-says-ankur-tiwari/articleshow/125122847.cms,"'India Will Be AI Skills Capital Of World': UpGrad Enterprises CEO Srikanth Iyengar I Podcast





PUNE: AI-inspired digital innovator Ankur Tiwari believes that artificial intelligence will no longer be a choice but a baseline for businesses seeking to thrive in the digital economy. Addressing a virtual session of engineering graduates, Tiwari said that enterprises must move beyond static digital platforms and embrace intelligent systems that anticipate customer needs even before they are expressed.“The next wave of digital transformation will be about proactive experiences—AI systems that understand intent, predict demand, and deliver outcomes in real time,” Tiwari said. “Companies that fail to adopt such intelligent systems will struggle to stay relevant in the evolving digital ecosystem.”Tiwari, who has architected AI-driven digital platforms for global enterprises, explained how artificial intelligence and machine learning are now shaping the future of content management and customer engagement. His focus has been on transforming traditional systems into intelligent ecosystems capable of personalizing, predicting, and automating experiences at scale.Under his guidance, several Fortune 500 companies have achieved measurable results by integrating AI-based content orchestration.One major retailer reported a 40 percent increase in customer engagement and a 22 percent drop in cart abandonment, while a healthcare provider cut manual content review time by 35 percent and accelerated campaign deployment by 50 percent.According to Tiwari, the age of static websites and manual content processes is ending. He noted that intelligent automation—such as real-time personalization, predictive analytics, and smart metadata tagging—is reshaping how companies interact with consumers. “Content can no longer be treated as a fixed asset. It needs to be dynamic, predictive, and intelligent—adjusting in real time to inform, engage, and convert,” he said.A frequent keynote speaker at global technology conferences including the Adobe Summit and IEEE World Conference on Applied Intelligence and Computing, Tiwari is known for translating complex AI concepts into practical business solutions. His innovations have led to patented technologies, including AI-based systems for content analysis and personalized referral mechanisms that enhance user experience through explainable machine learning.Tiwari urged the next generation of engineers to see artificial intelligence not merely as a technical skill but as a force shaping the future of global enterprise. “AI is the new architecture of digital experience,” he said. “Those who learn to build with it will design the future.”",Ankur Tiwari believes that artificial intelligence will no longer be a choice but a baseline for businesses seeking to thrive in the digital economy.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Emily Austin’s “Hot Girls for Cuomo” Campaign

The 0,10 and 20 rationale: A misstep in messaging

The domain fiasco and the campaign’s collapse

The New York Post

A final reckoning: Campaigns and Influence in the digital age





As Zohran Mamdani’s historic victory as New York City’s first Muslim mayor came to fruition, making him the 111th mayor after defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, an unexpected subplot played out in the final stretch of the campaign: The emergence of “Hot Girls for Zohran,” a movement driven by young women seeking change, was met by a rival “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign, launched by conservative influencer Emily Austin. What followed was an ironic spectacle, a classic case of a copycat campaign gone wrongZohran Mamdani’s rise in the mayoral race wasn’t just a victory of ideas, but of a movement. Unlike other campaigns that rely heavily on top-down strategy, Mamdani’s appeal lay in his ability to tap into an undercurrent of frustration felt by many young New Yorkers. Rising housing costs, stagnant wages, and a widening income gap had created a generation of voters who felt shut out of the city they called home.The phrasedidn’t emerge in a vacuum. It was inspired by the viral momentum ofwhich gained traction during Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign. That movement was born out of a desire to counter the “Bernie Bro” stereotype, an image of Sanders supporters as predominantly male, gruff, and internet-obsessed. Spearheaded by model Emily Ratajkowski , the hashtag aimed to show that young women could be just as invested in Sanders's vision for progressive change.Mamdani’s campaign revived theslogan, but with a twist. It wasn’t about appearance or exclusivity. Instead, it offered a cheeky, non-gendered way for voters to identify with Mamdani’s progressive vision.Typical of New York’s chaotic, impromptu energy, the movement even sparked a Zohran Mamdani lookalike competition, showcasing the candidate’s unexpected stardom and celebrity reach. The movement gained traction fast, spilling out of the ivy-covered walls of Columbia and Barnard and into the streets of New York City as students, celebrities, and everyday New Yorkers helped turn Mamdani’s campaign into a cultural phenomenon, vibrant, unpredictable, and impossible to ignore.What started as a handful of passionate students quickly snowballed, with volunteers canvassing door-to-door, hosting meet-ups, and flooding social media with posts. It wasn’t just a campaign; it became a grassroots groundswell. Merchandise and printed tees bearing the ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" slogan went viral on Instagram, adding a layer of digital fervour to the city's streets.Celebrity endorsements and local activists joined the cause, and soon it wasn’t just about one candidate, it was about a community on fire, united by the belief that Mamdani was the messiah who would deliver them from a city drowning in overpriced rent, artisanal lattes, and $15 avocado toasts.The rise of “Hot Girls for Zohran” did not go unnoticed, especially by the Cuomo camp. With former governor Andrew Cuomo trailing behind Mamdani in the polls, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa seen as too far removed from the race to be a real contender, there was a sense of urgency in the air. It was at this point that Emily Austin, a 24-year-old conservative influencer, stepped into the fray.Austin, a media-savvy Long Island native known for her right-wing views, launched the “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign in late October. Unlike Mamdani’s grassroots movement, Austin’s attempt at creating a political coalition felt more like a branded marketing campaign, aimed at taking advantage of the growingtrend.Her pitch was straightforward, if not a little contrived: “If you’re a hot girl for Andrew Cuomo, I want to hear from you,” she announced in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter). Austin’s use of the term “hot” was designed to grab attention and create a sense of exclusivity. But for her, being “hot” wasn’t just about physical appearance; it was about intelligence and aligning with what she viewed as common sense.She tried to frame Cuomo as the antidote to Mamdani’s “socialism,” repeatedly voicing her belief that Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa should drop out to give Cuomo a better chance of defeating Mamdani. In her view, voting for Sliwa was, effectively, voting for Mamdani, a sentiment she voiced on X, insisting that Cuomo was the only viable option to stop the socialist candidate.But therein lay the flaw in Austin’s approach. Where Mamdani’s campaign had successfully mobilised people based on shared political goals and values, Austin’s initiative came across as a surface-level stunt. The idea that political allegiance could be reduced to physical attractivenes, however tongue-in-cheek—undermined the sincerity of the movement. Austin’s branding took the slogan literally: “Hot Girls” were to be identified by their looks, and, by extension, their support for Cuomo was tied to their perceived “common sense. ” The implication was that anyone who supported Mamdani was, quite simply, a “zero.”Austin’s campaign was grounded in the idea that supporting Cuomo would somehow elevate women, casting them as more desirable and intellectually sound in comparison to those backing Mamdani. “I don’t care if you’re the hottest girl physically, if you’re voting for Mamdani, you’re a zero because clearly you lack IQ,” she toldOne could argue that Mamdani’s campaign also attracted its share of attractive figures, but for Austin, the focus was different. Her approach revolved around leveraging beauty as political capital, casting voting for Cuomo as a way to increase one’s perceived worth. In Austin’s equation, a “10” who voted for Mamdani became a “0,” while a “10” backing Cuomo became a “20.” It was a logic rooted in appearance, not policy, attempting to turn attractiveness into an endorsement of political ideology.It’s likely that Austin, much like some of the influencers who backed Mamdani, was hoping for a bandwagon effect, a trend of beauty queens and “tens” following along to sway the voter base. The idea was that by seducing the electorate with the right looks, she could push Cuomo into a stronger position. However, this strategy backfired, reducing the political conversation to superficiality and undermining any substantive engagement with the issues at hand.In the end, Austin’s focus on beauty, rather than substance, only alienated potential supporters, turning her campaign into an object lesson in how not to mobilise voters.But the campaign's missteps didn’t end with Austin’s messaging. In a move that perfectly encapsulated the disorganised nature of her campaign, Austin forgot to secure the domain name for “Hot Girls for Cuomo.” In an era where digital presence is just as crucial as the message itself, this was a critical oversight. As she admitted to, “I didn’t know ‘Hot Girls for Cuomo’ needed a site… and if I had ever foresaw that, of course I would’ve bought the domain.”Before she could even begin to build a website or establish a legitimate digital platform, an anti-Cuomo activist swiftly snatched up the domain name HotGirlsForCuomo.com. Instead of leading to Austin’s campaign, the website redirected visitors to a page detailing the New York Attorney General Letitia James's investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s sexual harassment allegations.The 2021 report, which Cuomo has denied, revealed a pattern of inappropriate behaviour, including unwanted touching, sexually suggestive comments, and other advances made by Cuomo towards multiple women during his time in office. The report also stated that Cuomo’s actions were not limited to staff members but extended to state employees and members of the public, including a State Trooper assigned to his detail.This catastrophic blunder added to the growing irony surrounding Austin’s campaign. She had been outmanoeuvred by a domain name purchase, and what was intended to be a catchy political stunt was now inexorably tethered to one of the darkest chapters of Cuomo's career, thrusting his sexual harassment scandal, which resulted in his resignation as governor, back into the spotlight.Emily Austin’s “Hot Girls for Cuomo” campaign, which was meant to rival “Hot Girls for Zohran,” quickly unravelled under the weight of its own contradictions. While Mamdani’s movement grew organically, with a focus on tangible political change, Austin’s influencer-led campaign collapsed under its own superficiality.For all her media-savvy, Austin underestimated the depth of political engagement in New York City, particularly among young women who felt a deep connection to Mamdani’s promises. The focus on looks and intelligence made her campaign seem dismissive of voters' genuine concerns. Mamdani, on the other hand, mobilised his supporters with a clear message of change and inclusivity, not with slogans built around physical appearance.While “Hot Girls for Zohran” was about rallying diverse supporters behind Mamdani’s vision for a fairer city, “Hot Girls for Cuomo” fell flat, exposed by a lack of authenticity and an ill-conceived strategy. In the end, Mamdani’s victory was a testament to the power of genuine political movements, while Austin’s campaign served as a cautionary tale of how a shallow, copy-paste campaign can fail when it misses the real issues that matter most.However, Austin still, undeterred by her campaign's failure, has already hinted at her next project: “Hot Girls for Vance,” aiming to back JD Vance in a potential 2028 presidential run. She commented, “I’m starting a ‘Hot Girls for Vance.’ I’m now gonna ride this wave.”","Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s first Muslim mayor after defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.
