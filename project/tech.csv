Candidates won't get poll booth CCTV footage: EC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/candidates-wont-get-poll-booth-cctv-footage-ec/articleshow/116548316.cms,"Congress to contest EC’s poll rules tweak in courts ‘right away



NEW DELHI: Election Commission has brought changes in electoral rules to specify that CCTV footage of poll booths will not come under the category of ""documents"" to be made available to contestants and general public. Before the amendment, the provision under Section 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules said ""all other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection"" with court permission.Congress was quick to latch on to the changes and accused the Modi govt and EC of hurting transparency and eroding the integrity of the electoral process, but the poll panel said it was done to protect the privacy of voters and for their safety.The changes were triggered after the Punjab and Haryana high court recently directed EC to provide copies of required documents related to the Haryana assembly elections to advocate Mehmood Pracha.He had filed a petition seeking the videography, CCTV camera footage, and copies of Forms 17-C Parts I and II related to the conduct of elections.The existing rules do not contain any specific obligation on part of EC to provide any videographic record or CCTV footage to the public. The detailed rules have a list of records which can be made public , after directions from a competent court. Friday’s amendment has added a line where Section 93, in sub-section (2), in clause (a), after the word ‘papers’, the words ‘as specified in these rules’ shall be inserted. By adding this clarification, EC has made it clear that ‘papers’ would not include any documents or electronic records which have not been specified in the rules.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said his party would challenge this amendment in courts “right away”. He said, “If there was ever a vindication of our assertions regarding eroding integrity of the electoral process managed by EC in recent times, this is it.”EC sources, however, justified the changes and said restriction of making available CCTV footage to anyone was to avoid mischief and for the safety concerns of voters. “Sharing of CCTV footage may have serious repercussions, specially in sensitive areas like J&K, Naxal-affected regions etc where secrecy is important and the lives of voters are at risk for participating in the democratic process,” a senior EC official said.All election papers and documents are otherwise available for public inspection. Candidates in any case have access to all documents, papers and records. “Even Pracha was entitled for all the records from his constituency,” the official added. Sources in EC said the rule mentioned election paper documents and did not in any way specifically refer to electronic records. “In order to remove this ambiguity and considering… potential misuse of CCTV footage of inside the polling station using AI by a single person, the rule has been amended…” an EC official said.",The changes were triggered after the Punjab and Haryana high court recently directed EC to provide copies of required documents to advocate Mehmood Pracha.

"From AI weddings to massages, art that puts you in the picture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-ai-weddings-to-massages-art-that-puts-you-in-the-picture/articleshow/116549116.cms,"Remember that not-so-iconic song by Himesh Reshammiya which went 'No touching, only seeing. Understand?' That kind of sums up the attitude of most museums and galleries. An attendant swoops in the minute it looks like you might lay your grubby little paws on their shiny masterpieces. But at the art exhibition curated by the talented duo of Thukral & Tagra (T&T) for Goa's Serendipity Festival, not only are there no paintings, the audience is encouraged to get touchy-feely.You can have a massage, or a haircut, do a sculpting workshop in a dark room with renowned sculptor L N Tallur, walk on a canvas to create your own indigo painting, or find an AI spouse of your dreams. The last one got your attention, right? Artist Shailesh BR, who trained as a priest, has built an AI machine that poses a set of questions to find out if you're the right match. ""Three people have been 'married' till now, and the last one had a big smile on her face,"" says Shailesh, who calls himself a mechanic on Instagram. Asked why, he points to the other device he has created - one that throws red rice at you as a bridal blessing. He also built a prayer machine earlier. ""It's not just about having fun. I wanted the audience to examine why they take part in religious rituals without understanding or questioning them,"" he says.But before you get up close with the art at Panaji's beautiful old GMC complex, viewers are urged to deposit their phones in envelopes and set them on silent. The idea, says Sumir Tagra, is not to see the art through your phones but feel it and touch it. Phones deposited, you can perch comfortably on Chainpreet's sofa to watch a satirical video and drawings created by graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee. But, of course, the first question that pops up is who is this Chainpreet whose drawing room (the space looks like one) one has entered. ""She's a mix of the Sardarnis that I have known. Like most of us, she hits the sofa in the evening and falls into a wormhole of doom scrolling. Besides her spineless boyfriend, I have shown some of her pet peeves through my drawings - overly optimized Indians only focused on winning and NRIs with their overdose of nationalism and nostalgia,"" says Banerjee.A few rooms further on is more art you can sit on. Saurabh Dakshini, who runs an architecture and design studio in Delhi, has created twin chairs that set fans in motion when you rock but the breezy efforts of your labour are enjoyed by the person in the other chair. Talking of enjoyment, in a room enticingly called book massages, therapists encourage you to select a passage, listen to it being read aloud on headphones while getting a massage. So, an Arundhati Roy chapter can earn you a 15-minute neck massage. Thukral & Tagra's collaborative project titled Nafrat/Parvah (hate/care) invites you to deposit an object you hate with a note and in exchange you get care services such as a haircut or beard trim. While someone had put in their pack of cigarettes, and another a lip balm, one submission was particularly searing: A belt, hated because it evokes memories of a father's beating.One can almost hear the questions popping up - How is this art? Does this new wave of interactive works constitute the gamification of art? Can we experience art by playing with it? ""This is an experiment in participatory art,"" explains Tagra. ""There are zero paintings but people touching the art is the picture."" They can use it to express themselves too. Mobile balcaos - a traditional Goan porch - were parked in Panaji's markets, parks and even a bus stand so that locals and tourists could pen their thoughts on postcards. The angst about the 'Delhification' of Goa was clearly visible on the postcard wall.As for what is art, the definition seems to be ever-changing. Remember the $6.2m banana artwork that gave everyone indigestion wondering why anyone would pay that price for it? It's now in the collector's stomach! ""It's the artist's intention that makes it art,"" says Tagra, whose curation attempts to close the distance between artwork and audience though he would rather you not try eating any of the art. But you can listen to them. Just a floor above T&T's show are works by curator Veerangana Solanki who encourages artists to explore the links between touch, sound and memory.Not just the art, the food lab too is about conversations. Every evening, it hosted 'Mock Wild' picnics where AI prompts were turned into actual recipes that people could taste or you could board games that introduced you to India's medicinal plants or go on seaweed-collecting incursions along the coast. The focus was always on the tactile, the live and the dynamic. As Sunil Kant Munjal, founding member of the festival and chairman of Hero Enterprise, puts it, ""This festival cannot be explained, it can only be experienced.""","Serendipity Festival in Goa is an exhibition where the audience is encouraged to get touchy-feely.

Caitlin Clark

“I noticed here that coaches here are giving her – not pushing her – but giving her some physicality.”

“That is something that a lot of people have also been talking about online with Caitlin Clark. It seems like she has already gotten a little bit bulkier since the end of the season,”

“Obviously she’s a one-of-a-kind basketball player, but the thing is, she’s not a one-of-a-kind person in the weight room. She has this very high skill set in basketball, but her physical development could really be improved.”

“I think it’s going to be very hard to guard her if she masters her touch at the basket. Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves,”

“Now I don’t know if that’s because she has been straight in the weight room getting her reps in or it’s the fact that she played an entire NBA season with college and her first WNBA season and she pretty much played like 40 minutes a game,”

“Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves.”

’s numerous achievement is mostly based on her performance on the court. It looks like her rise to stardom is back to where it belongs — on the basketball court. After months of attention centered on accolades like her TIME magazine honor and debates about her impact on the WNBA , the focus has returned to her game.The shift in Clark’s approach is clear. A recent training video shared by the Indiana Fever’s social media accounts showcased Clark practicing her skills while coaches incorporated more physicality into her drills. This approach is no accident. Analyst Rachel DeMita noted in her YouTube video,Physicality has become a key talking point for Caitlin Clark’s development, and it’s not just about what’s happening in practice. Fans and analysts alike have observed a noticeable change in her physique.DeMita remarked.This evolution in Clark’s approach isn’t new. During her senior year at Iowa, Clark gained 8 pounds and this was because her opponents were physically targeting her. Iowa’s associate strength and conditioning coach, Lindsay Alexander, reflected on her progress, saying,Clark’s offseason training isn’t limited to physical gains. Reports suggest she’s sharpening critical elements of her game, including ball handling, off-balance finishing, mid-range shots, screen navigation, and, of course, her long-distance three-pointers.DeMita emphasized that this enhanced version of Clark will be a nightmare for opposing defenses.she stated.There’s also speculation about the source of Clark’s bulkier frame. DeMita posed an interesting theory, suggesting that her grueling schedule since her senior year at Iowa — playing college basketball, Olympic games, and her first WNBA season — might have contributed to the change.she explained.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 The WNBA’s 12 teams and 144 players will have to adjust to Caitlin Clark’s new training and transformation.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are spending the holiday season together. Kelce, along with his sister-in-law Kylie, discussed making the appropriate atmosphere for the holidays by picking and watching their favorite Christmas movie. It was while appearing on the New Heights hotline that Kylie Kelce suggested to her husband Jason and Kansas City Chiefs star that he and his brother-in-law watch and critique Love Actually, the Hugh Grant starring film. However, Travis Kelce quickly spiked Kylie's suggestion to watch the film, even though it is a favorite of his pop superstar girlfriend.During one of the episodes of the New Heights podcast, Kylie Kelce, wife of Jason Kelce, suggested that Travis and Jason should watch Taylor Swift's ""Love Actually"" this Christmas season, as she wanted to nominate a movie for the next movie.""Love Actually is a tremendous movie that you can really sit down with your significant others and enjoy because it’s not like one of your significant others hasn’t asked you to watch it multiple times and you said no every time,"" she said, apparently referring to her husband. ""So, this would be a great excuse to get you to watch it. OK, I hope you take this into consideration.”""I think we both can probably agree we’re not doing ‘Love Actually,'"" Jason said. ""Yeah, probably not,"" Travis agreed. ""I’ll do, like, a really good Christmas movie though.” When Kylie said that she would come on if they reviewed ""Love Actually,"" Travis did not even think that it would change one thing about how they felt, but Jason suggested he go on Kylie's new podcast ""Not Gonna Lie"" to do the review. ""Yeah, don’t f---ing torture me. Torture your husband,"" Travis said. ""I’m an innocent bystander here, Ky. Don’t f---ing come for me.”Taylor Swift expressed her admiration for the multi-starrer film, which stars Grant, Keira Knightley, and Liam Neeson, in an interview with a media portal. She told Teen Vogue, ""Did you ever watch the movie ‘Love Actually’ where Hugh Grant’s voiceover says, ‘If you look around, love actually is all around?’ That’s my favorite motto.”Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour Party: Has Travis Kelce Completely Changed Her World?

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

NFL streaming schedule on Netflix

What make NFL streaming on Netflix BIG

Netflix is reportedly pulling out all the stops for its two Christmas Day NFL games, including a pre-game performance by Mariah Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" According to a report by news agency AP, however, there is anxiety. For, the steaming giant recognizes that technical difficulties could ruin the experience. As Netflix executive Brandon Riegg, VP of nonfiction series and sports, told AP, that the memory of the streaming issues encountered during the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight on November 14 is mit fresh.Riegg, while addressing the concerns about Netflix's readiness for a potentially record-breaking viewership, added with a caution that the sheer volume of viewers for the fight overwhelmed the system, despite extensive pre-event testing. While acknowledging the issues experienced by some viewers, Riegg emphasized that the event served as a crucial stress test, leading to numerous system improvements.""The sheer tonnage of people that came to watch was incredible. And for all the testing that the engineering team had done ahead of that, and I think they’re the best in the business, the only way to test something of that magnitude is to have something of that magnitude,” Riegg said. “We never want to have technical issues or a disappointing experience for our members. There was a subset of people that were watching that struggled with that and we acknowledge that. The good news is they stress-tested the system to such a degree that there’s a lot of these fixes and improvements that they realized that they could make, and they’re applying all that stuff.”Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show starting at 11 a.m. EST, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. EST. These games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries, marking the first global distribution of an NFL game by a single outlet. This marks the first year of a three-year deal, with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026, at a cost of $150 million for this year's package. While a full season package doesn't align with Netflix's strategy, the Christmas Day games presented a unique opportunity.This move signals Netflix's broader ambition to become a major destination for sports fans, evidenced by its recent acquisition of U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup and its upcoming partnership with WWE, beginning January 6th with ""Monday Night Raw.""The Tyson-Paul fight drew a global audience of 60 million, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams (38 million in the U.S.). However, Down Detector reported nearly 85,000 viewer complaints of outages and streaming problems leading up to the fight. This contrasts with previous benchmarks for streamed NFL games: 23 million viewers on Peacock for last season's AFC wild card game and 17.3 million on Amazon Prime Video for a regular-season game.The NFL's decision to schedule games on Christmas, despite it falling on a Wednesday, is reportedly driven by the potential for increased viewership. Last year's three Christmas games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The league approved two Christmas games in March, prompting Netflix's interest. Their existing relationship with the NFL through series like ""Quarterback"" and ""Receiver"" facilitated the deal.","Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show. The games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries. This marks the first year of a three-year deal with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116547281,imgsize-43782,width-400,resizemode-4/116547281.jpg"

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
