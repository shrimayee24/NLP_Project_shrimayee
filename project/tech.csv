Hailee Steinfeld on addresses rumours surrounding Avengers: Doomsday

A busy schedule with new projects and a high-profile relationship

Despite being one of the rising stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe , Hailee Steinfeld ’s name was noticeably absent from the recent cast announcement for Avengers: Doomsday . Fans immediately questioned why the actress, who debuted as Kate Bishop in Hawkeye and appeared in the post-credits scene of The Marvels, wasn’t given one of the now-famous personalized “Doomsday” chairs alongside other confirmed Avengers.In a recent interview with Backstage to promote her upcoming horror film Sinners , Hailee Steinfeld finally addressed the speculation surrounding her MCU future.“I’m excited about the idea of continuing to grow with a character like Kate, especially in something as huge as the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” Steinfeld said. “You get to go back to your family; you get to go back to that little home that then becomes part of this grander picture. I love that character, and I totally understand why she is so loved.”While Marvel fans were hoping for a full Young Avengers lineup reveal, both Steinfeld and her onscreen ally Iman Vellani (Kamala Khan) were missing from the official casting list, raising questions about whether Marvel is saving their returns as surprise moments—or if their roles have been pushed to future projects.Steinfeld is keeping her plate full outside of the MCU. She stars opposite Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo in Sinners, a vampire thriller directed by Black Panther filmmaker Ryan Coogler. The film is already gaining buzz thanks to Coogler’s involvement and Steinfeld’s unexpected role in the horror genre.She’s also set to return as the voice of Spider-Gwen in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, arriving June 4, 2027, and will appear in the animated series Marvel Zombies premiering on October 3, 2025, on Disney+.Hailee Steinfeld and her fiancé, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen , have cultivated a relationship that balances fame with authenticity.

Mixing ingredients not only results in a variety of unique effects but also adds a layer of excitement and strategy as you aim to cater to the specific tastes of your clientele. While some recipes are well-known, others are hidden gems that offer bizarre or powerful effects. Here, we’ll explore three unique mixing recipes in Schedule 1 that you may not have tried yet.One of the more humorous effects you can achieve in Schedule 1 is the Shrinking effect. This particular recipe causes the consumer to shrink in size, making them appear as small as a leprechaun.

While it may sound absurd, it can prove useful in certain situations where speed and agility are key. Here’s how to make it:This concoction is not only a fun twist on traditional drug effects but also offers players an interesting challenge in crafting such an unusual mix.If you're looking for a truly dangerous and high-risk recipe, the Explosive mix should be on your radar. This recipe causes the consumer to explode, which is not only one of the most dangerous effects in the game but also a dramatic example of how far you can push the limits of the game’s mechanics. While it’s sure to create chaos, it’s definitely a recipe that should be used sparingly. Here’s how to make the explosive brew:Due to its sheer power and risk, this recipe is a must-avoid for most players looking to maintain stability in their drug empire. But for those daring enough to try it, it adds a thrilling challenge to the gameplay.This recipe is one of the most complex and unique combinations available in Schedule 1. The mixture creates a series of effects that include Seizure-Inducing, Electrifying, Anti-Gravity, and Glowing. It’s an overwhelming mix of effects that can be both entertaining and chaotic, especially for NPCs who consume it. The sheer variety of effects makes this a fascinating experiment for players who enjoy creating unpredictable outcomes. The recipe is as follows:This concoction offers a range of effects that can keep both you and your customers on your toes. With a little bit of experimentation, it might just turn out to be the perfect high for your high-profile clientele.Schedule 1 provides a unique and humorous approach to drug manufacturing within the game, allowing players to experiment with a wide range of ingredients and effects.

Ja Morant on his grenade-hurling gesture

Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies is currently keeping NBA fans hooked with his new style of celebration — hurling a fake grenade into the crowd and shutting his ears. The 25-year-old has said it’s not what it appears to be. Morant has previously been fined for a celebratory gesture of a similar nature, and another fine may be in the offing.When asked about the gesture, Morant said, “It’s not what you think it is. I’m gonna take my words, I’m gonna throw them out there, and I’mma block out the noise.” He added, “That’s my celebration now until somebody else has a problem with it, and I’ll find another one.”Recently, a video of him pretending to hurl a grenade into the crowd and then covering his ears with his hands went viral. The internet however, remained divided over Morant’s actions. An X user wrote, “It's all for entertainment now.... Ja Morant knows the eyes on him...#NBA.” Another said, “This is the greatest celebration currently in sports.” One more commented, “I know that’s right! Cut the noise (negative energy) and you find yourself elevating in every area! @JaMorant you are here to positively impact, and you are, so just keep doing it. You’re not alone!”Some also called him “crazy” and wondered if he could soon invite a fine for the same. “Just take the fine bro,” wrote one. An X user also wrote, “And he will play victim when he gets fined again for something 100% avoidable.” A person also said, “This celebration is lowkey cold.” On the other hand, someone called it “dope”.Also Read: Ja Morant defies criticism from Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith and says he will keep using grenade celebration Ja Morant gained attention during the Memphis Grizzlies vs. Charlotte Hornets match last week when he performed the grenade-hurling act to celebrate a three-pointer for the first time.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Why Google introduced this feature

Google has introduced a new security feature for Android devices that will automatically restart phones and tablets if they remain locked for three consecutive days. The update, rolled out via Google Play Services version 25.14 , aims to enhance data protection and prevent unauthorised access.“Google System updates make your Android devices more secure and reliable, and give you new and useful features. They include updates from Google to the Android operating system, Google Play Store, and Google Play services. Google System updates are available for phones, tablets, Android TV and Google TV devices, Android Auto-enabled devices, cars with Android Automotive OS or Google built-in, Wear OS devices, and Chrome OS devices. [Phone] Enables a future optional security feature, which will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days,” said the company.The new functionality ensures that if an Android device remains unused and locked for 72 hours, it will automatically restart. Upon reboot, the phone enters the ""Before First Unlock"" (BFU) state, where all user data remains fully encrypted until the passcode is entered. This prevents forensic tools and unauthorised users from accessing sensitive information.The move follows similar security measures introduced by Apple in iOS 18.1, known as ""Inactivity Reboot."" The goal is to make it harder for law enforcement agencies or hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in devices that have been left idle. Once a phone is restarted, biometric logins such as fingerprint or face unlock are disabled until the user manually enters their passcode.Cybersecurity experts have praised the update, noting that it adds an extra layer of protection against data breaches, phone theft, and forensic hacking attempts.","Google rolls out new security feature for Android devices.

A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization. Dubbed the “ChatGPT Action Figure Trend,” this phenomenon is giving users the opportunity to create hyper-realistic images of themselves as collectible dolls or action figures—complete with toy box packaging, accessories, and thematic designs. The viral trend is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which now includes image generation capabilities through DALL·E, enabling users to craft customized toy-like avatars using a combination of uploaded photos and descriptive prompts.This trend follows a series of internet-wide moments in which AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, have enabled viral self-expression—such as Studio Ghibli-inspired portraits and AI-generated yearbook photos. The recent rise in ChatGPT traffic—reaching a record 184.4 million global visits on April 9, 2025, according to Similarweb—indicates not just interest in generative AI, but its growing cultural relevance in user-led digital art and identity play.Here’s everything to know about the ChatGPT action figure trend , how it works, what platforms are driving it, and why it's capturing the imagination of millions.The ChatGPT Action Figure Trend is a user-generated movement where individuals use AI to design digital images of themselves as action figures or Barbie-style dolls. The characters often appear inside a branded toy box, accompanied by miniature accessories, clothing, and backdrops that reflect the user’s personality, profession, or hobbies.While there is no confirmed origin for the trend, it rapidly gained traction on TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit. The posts typically show the AI-generated doll and its box art, along with a caption describing the user's design choices. Some themes parody pop culture archetypes—like “Corporate Coffee Warrior” or “Freelance Chaos Coder”—while others take a more sincere, biographical approach.The trend taps into both nostalgia and novelty. For many, it recalls childhood memories of unboxing dolls or action figures, now merged with cutting-edge AI customization. The result is a quirky but powerful form of self-representation.To start, users need a ChatGPT account. The feature works best on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which includes GPT-4 and access to image generation tools like DALL·E 3. Free-tier users have limited access to image prompts and cannot upload personal images directly.Users can upload a selfie or a full-body photograph to help the AI better understand facial features, body proportions, and attire. The image is used by ChatGPT to render a more accurate digital likeness.Users then enter a detailed prompt instructing the AI to generate a toy box image of themselves. The prompt can include:Within seconds to a few minutes, ChatGPT generates an image that matches the description. The final result often looks like a professional marketing photo for a real-life toy.The success of the ChatGPT Action Figure Trend can be attributed to several factors:While fun and engaging, the trend has some caveats:Additionally, concerns have been raised about the long-term ethical implications of AI-generated identity manipulation and the use of personal data in training models—although OpenAI maintains that user-uploaded images are not used to train future models.","A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization.
