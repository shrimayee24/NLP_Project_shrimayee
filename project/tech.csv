Chicago Bulls injury report for tonight’s game against the Philadelphia 76ers (February 24, 2025)

When and where to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play tonight against the Chicago Bulls (February 24, 2025)?

Theface mounting challenges as they prepare to host the Chicago Bulls on Monday, February 24, at the Wells Fargo Center. With six players listed on the injury report, including star center, the team’s prospects for the game remain uncertain. Embiid, a pivotal figure for the 76ers, is marked as questionable due to a knee injury, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his availability. Joel Embiid ’s potential absence could significantly impact the Philadelphia 76ers, who are already struggling with a 20-36 record this season. The reigning MVP has been a cornerstone of the team’s performance, and his limited presence on the court has coincided with the team’s recent struggles. Alongside Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, the team’s leading scorer with 27.4 points per game, is also questionable due to a finger injury. The duo’s uncertain status adds to the growing list of concerns for Philadelphia, which includes Jared McCain (out for the season), Eric Gordon (wrist), Kyle Lowry (hip), and Justin Edwards (ankle). The 76ers ’ offensive output has been lackluster, averaging 108.9 points per game, ranking 26th in the league. Defensively, they allow 113.0 points per contest, placing then 14th. Without Joel Embiid and Maxey, the team’s ability to compete against the Bulls, who average 115.9 points per game (10th in the NBA), could be severely compromised.On the Bulls’ side, injuries have also taken a toll, with Patrick Williams (knee), Ayo Dosunmu (shoulder), and Jalen Smith (face) ruled out. However, Coby White, who averages 12.8 points per game, is listed as probable despite an ankle issue. Chicago’s Nikola Vucevic, averaging 19.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, will likely pose a significant challenge for the 76ers’ depleted lineup.The game, scheduled for 7:00 PM ET, will be broadcast on NBCS-PH and CHSN, with live streaming available on Fubo. As the 76ers navigate their injury woes, Joel Embiid’s status remains the focal point. His presence could provide a much-needed boost, but his absence would further highlight the team’s struggles in an already difficult season.Fans eagerly await updates on Embiid’s condition, as his availability could determine whether the 76ers can halt their downward spiral or if the Bulls will capitalize on their opponent’s vulnerabilities.","The Philadelphia 76ers host the Chicago Bulls on Monday, February 24, at the Wells Fargo Center.

Kevin Durant Shuts Down Rumors About $60M Rapper’s Kendrick Lamar Beef: Here’s Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kevin-durant-shuts-down-rumors-about-60m-rappers-kendrick-lamar-beef-heres-why/articleshow/118512414.cms,"Credits: NBA and Getty Images

Kevin Durant's No-Look Pass on Hip-Hop Beef: Why KD Isn't Here for the ""Fake Tough Guy"" Stuff

From alley-oops to hot takes, Kevin Durant is known for his smooth moves on and off the court. He's a hoops legend, a social media maven, and apparently, a hip-hop head with some strong opinions. While KD’s known to rep Drake (who, let’s be real, probably has a custom-made OVO jersey just for KD), he’s now weighing in on the Kendrick Lamar-J. Cole's situation, and he's not holding back. This isn’t just your average sports commentator dabbling in music this is a full-court press on hip-hop culture.Over the weekend, Durant dribbled his way into the discourse surrounding J. Cole 's new single, CLOUDs, released via Cole's blog. Durant’s tweet, a swift and decisive crossover move, read: ""I don't care bout none of that fake tough guy shit. This is mastery."" Now, what’s so special about this track? It’s Cole’s first release since Port Antonio in October 2024, and it comes amidst the lingering fallout from his brief entanglement in the Drake-Kendrick Lamar beef.Remember last April? Kendrick dropped some lyrical bombs on both Drake and Cole in Future and Metro Boomin’s Like That. Cole responded with 7 Minute Drill, a diss track aimed at Lamar. But, in a move that shocked fans, Cole pulled the song from streaming services and publicly apologized to Kendrick. This apology, while perhaps showing maturity, also opened Cole up to criticism, with many labeling him as soft. Durant, however, isn’t buying into the ""fake tough guy"" narrative. He’s clearly impressed by Cole's artistry, and he's not afraid to say it, even if it means going against the grain.Durant's tweet isn’t just about CLOUDs. It seems to be a broader statement about the culture of hip-hop and the pressure artists face to maintain a certain image. KD, who's seen his share of tough competition on the court, recognizes true skill and artistry when he sees it, regardless of the surrounding drama. He's essentially saying, ""Forget the beef, focus on the bars.""ALSO READ: Miami Heat vs. Milwaukee Bucks Game Preview (02/23): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More NBA star Kevin Durant recently shared his perspectives on rapper Kendrick Lamar , continuing his engagement with hip-hop culture. This follows his earlier commentary on Kendrick's Super Bowl halftime performance earlier this month. Durant has demonstrated himself to be more than just a casual listener of hip-hop music, showing deep investment in the culture and genuine appreciation for the art form. His involvement highlights the growing connection between professional sports and popular culture, as Durant continues to provide his insights on music alongside his basketball career.","NBA star Kevin Durant tweeted about J.

“Money talks”: Fans calls out Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as money-minded for ditching Yankees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/money-talks-fans-calls-out-vladimir-guerrero-jr-as-money-minded-for-ditching-yankees/articleshow/118509938.cms,"Image via: Mark Goldman/Getty Images



Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Sparks Debate: Is He Playing the Yankees Card for a Bigger Paycheck?



""Money Talks and Bulls Walk"": Fans Aren't Having It



Rumors in the MLB never settle down for long. There have been many whispers surrounding Guerrero Jr. and his future for most of the offseason, with Toronto Blue Jays fans and fans from all other circles hanging on his every word. Then, just when things looked like they were fading away, Vladimir put the kettle back on.Recently, Guerrero's interview found its way to raise some eyebrows, given his humor about loyalty to the team in light of the whispers that maybe he had a change of heart — and of course, money had to be brought into it. Starring Vladimir Guerrero Jr. decided to attack these rumors about his future head-on for a change.The slugger had fans scared he might head for the Bronx and was ready to clear the air. ""If I go to free agency, every team — all 30 teams — will have an opportunity to sit down with me, to talk to me."" So, he kind of said that he doesn't mind exploring his options but is not in a hurry to leave Toronto.Contrastingly, as usual, some fans read between the lines, and the discussion very quickly turned into a debate about Vlad's loyalty. Some others were quick to point out that he has probably got his newfound ""leverage"" in the negotiation game.Guerrero Jr. made things clear; fans refused to believe him. He had been quite vocal about never playing for the Yankees — until now. A handful of fans echoed the sentiment that this is just Vlad's attempt to drive up his market value. ""He said once upon a time never the Yankees, but money talks and bulls walk,"" one user commented, calling out Vlad for what they felt was an obvious attempt at using the Yankees name to secure a bigger payday.Some fans commented, ""What's he supposed to say? Of course, he is going to keep his options open."" Others were more adamant: ""Vlad would be silly not to. He wants that huge contract and the Yankees help drive up the max value most likely."" Fans believe this is all business. Guerrero Jr. is just trying to maneuver for his advantage, with free agency approaching shortly.For some reason, fans think that what Vlad comments is just another form of the game: using the Yankees' name to fuel speculations to raise his asking price for an age-old tactic, and there is no reason to think Guerrero Jr. is any different. After all, he knows where the money is - and that is not just in Toronto. Many believe the slugger has been maintaining this image of being pursued for the biggest contract possible with rumors of Yankee interest.And then there are a few thoughts otherwise: Maybe, just maybe, Guerrero Jr. is legitimately leaving his options open, as he said. The Blue Jays have attempted to fortify the roster, and perhaps, with additional talent like Anthony Santander, the team can keep him for the long term. But as per fans, invoking the Yankees is just a cool bargaining tactic that would only rest on his value.In the end, the fan reaction is clear: Guerrero Jr. is playing the game with free agency in view, and it's all about value. Whether he is really leaving Toronto or just using the Yankees to raise his contract value is still debatable. But one thing is for sure, ""money talks,"" and it is doing so very loudly at the moment.Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sparks speculation about his future, with fans debating whether his mention of free agency and the Yankees is a strategy to boost his market value or genuine interest.","Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sparked speculation about his future with a recent interview.

Conclave wins best film at BAFTAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/conclave-wins-best-picture-at-baftas-as-the-brutalist-takes-directing-and-acting-prizes/articleshow/118310797.cms,"LONDON: Papal thriller “ Conclave ” won four prizes including best picture on Sunday at the 78th British Academy Film Awards , where genre-bending musical “ Emilia Pérez ” proved that it’s still an awards contender despite a multipronged backlash that looked to have dented its chances.“The Brutalist” equaled the awards tally of “Conclave,"" scooping four trophies, including best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"
