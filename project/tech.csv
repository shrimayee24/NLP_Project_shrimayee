Bangladesh has banned several popular social media platforms, including Instagram , TikTok, WhatsApp , and YouTube, according to reports. Announced on Friday, August 2, this decision has restricted access to these widely-used social networks nationwide.Global Eyes News first reported the ban through its official X account, confirming that from Friday onward, access to these social media networks would be limited throughout Bangladesh.This decision comes shortly after a similar action by Turkey, which also announced a ban on Instagram earlier the same day.According to reports, this latest ban follows a previous suspension of Meta’s platforms Instagram and Facebook in July. The earlier shutdown was in response to widespread unrest witnessed in the country over quota reforms. Sources indicate that access to Meta's platforms was cut off via mobile networks around 12:15 PM on August 2. Unlike the previous comprehensive shutdown, the current restrictions are reportedly targeting mobile data connections.Reports suggest that the country’s internet speed had returned to normal levels on August 1. However, with millions of mobile network users affected by the Facebook restriction, there is an expected surge in the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which could potentially slow down overall internet speeds.This ban is part of a series of internet restrictions imposed in July. Mobile internet was first disabled on July 17, followed by a broadband shutdown on July 18. While broadband services were partially restored on July 23, mobile networks remained offline until July 28.","Bangladesh has banned several popular social media platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and YouTube.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's pre-recorded interview teaser has been released on YouTube, raising eyebrows about the interest of the Duke of Sussex.The couple, who stepped down as senior working royals in 2020, are set to feature in a new interview with US broadcaster CBS on Sunday, August 4 (US time). As soon as the teaser was released it went viral but all for the wrong reasons as an expert claimed that Prince Harry appeared “bored” and “disengaged.”Decoding the body language , the body expert Judi James claimed that Meghan Markle's engagement with the interview is powerful while the Duke of Sussex seems very ""disengaged"" as the couple spoke to Jane Pauley at the very start of the clip - appearing to hint at a sense of boredom, Express UK reported citing The Mirror.James said, ""Her engagement with the interviewer is as powerful as Harry’s disengagement signals at the start of this clip while the two women speak... We see him in the clip gazing off into the distance with a serious facial expression while his wife tells a much more sociable and emotional story.""During a discussion about the mental health of children, Meghan expressed a heartwarming sentiment regarding their young son and daughter.According to the expert, when the mother of two mentioned Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, she seemed ""besotted"".She observed: ""Meghan is seen changing her body language and vocal state to speak about her children, performing a massively coy smile with a puckered top lip and rounded cheeks and partially hiding her face with her hand as though proud but also cutely coy about referring to them.""""Telling the interviewer they are 'amazing' she goes into a besotted-looking state, glancing down as though visualising them in a 'moment' as she shakes her head and her vocal tone dips to an intimate 'throat-creak'.""Furthermore, James noted: ""But then she makes the link with her campaign message and her eyes bounce back to the interviewer, her brows raise and she gesticulates with her left hand to make her point with passion while Harry still gazes off into the distance, as yet un-activated.""","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's pre-recorded interview teaser has been released on YouTube.

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system created by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which operates under the regulatory oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Leveraging the IMPS infrastructure , UPI enables immediate transfer of funds between the bank accounts of any two parties.The primary purpose of UPI is to facilitate convenient and safe money transfers between bank accounts.It achieves this by integrating multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, enabling effortless transfers and merchant payments from a unified platform.Users can initiate payments using various identifiers such as UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and Indian Financial System Code (IFSC).

How to get your CIBIL Credit score without a PAN Card

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision. The US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.

Character.AI, known for its versatile chatbots, has announced a partnership with Google. The deal grants Google a non-exclusive license to Character.AI 's cutting-edge large language model technology. This collaboration brings Character.AI's founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, full circle. Both previously worked at Google, with Shazeer co-authoring the groundbreaking ""Attention Is All You Need"" paper.However, the AI landscape has seen a talent exodus, with many paper co-authors departing to launch their own ventures.Character.AI will continue to operate independently under interim CEO Dominic Perella, assuring its user base. ""Our talented team remains dedicated to building the Character.AI platform and serving our growing community,"" the company stated.This deal underscores the fierce competition for AI talent and technology. Recent months have seen Microsoft and Amazon recruit key personnel from promising AI startups.For Google, the partnership signals a focus on regaining its footing in AI. The release of OpenAI's ChatGPT spurred internal concerns about being overtaken despite past breakthroughs. Google has since merged its AI labs into Google DeepMind , led by AI luminary Demis Hassabis.""We're thrilled to welcome Shazeer back,"" a Google spokesperson said. Shazeer will rejoin DeepMind with a select team. He expressed excitement about returning and collaborating with Google DeepMind while acknowledging Character.AI's achievements, ""I'm proud of what we built together."" He believes the Google partnership will ensure Character.AI's ""continued success."" Financial details remain undisclosed.Character.AI initially aimed to create a flexible AI platform for developing various services. Last year, the founders envisioned a future where everyone could access personalized AI companions.The platform allows users to create chatbots impersonating anyone – real or fictional. Millions of chatbots have been created, some becoming popular conversation partners. For example, a bot mimicking the Genshin Impact character Raiden Shogun has received over 371 million messages.Recently, Character.AI expanded beyond text, introducing ""Character Calls"" for phone calls with chatbots and ""Character Voice"" for generating custom voices.While a return to Google seemed unlikely last year, this partnership signals a new chapter in the AI race, with established players and rising stars collaborating to push the boundaries of the field.","Character.AI, known for its versatile chatbots, has announced a partnership with Google.

In the digital age, financial transactions have become incredibly convenient. The rise of Unified Payments Interface (UPI), credit/debit cards, and ATMs has revolutionised the way we manage our finances. However, with these advancements comes an increase in financial scams. Many individuals fall prey to fraudulent activities, losing hard-earned money in the process.If you have experienced such a situation, it is essential to remain calm and take immediate action. This guide outlines the crucial steps to follow if you lose money via UPI, credit/debit cards, or ATM scams , helping you secure your finances and increase the chances of recovery.As soon as you detect any unauthorised transaction, contact your bank or card issuer immediately. Most financial institutions have dedicated helplines for reporting fraud. Time is critical in these situations; the sooner you report, the better the chances of freezing the fraudulent transaction. Provide all necessary details, including the transaction amount, time, and any relevant information that can assist in the investigation.To prevent further unauthorised transactions, request your bank to block your card or freeze your UPI account. This step is vital in minimising the potential damage to your finances. Most banks offer this service through their customer service numbers or mobile apps. Additionally, changing your online banking passwords and securing your accounts is advisable.Visit your bank's nearest branch or use their online complaint system to file a detailed report about the fraud. Ensure you include all pertinent information, such as transaction details and any correspondence with the fraudsters. This documentation is essential for the bank's investigation and potential reimbursement.Reporting the fraud to the Cyber Crime Cell in your city is crucial. You can submit a complaint online via the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at cybercrime.gov.in. Provide comprehensive details and any evidence you have to support your claim. Cybercrime cells are equipped to handle such cases and can coordinate with banks and other institutions to track the fraudsters.If the amount lost is substantial, filing a First Information Report (FIR) at your local police station is necessary. This legal step initiates a formal investigation, which is often required for any reimbursement claims from your bank. Make sure to include all required documents and detailed information about the scam.Stay in constant contact with your bank during the investigation. Banks usually require up to 10 business days to investigate fraud cases. Keeping a record of all communications and following up regularly can expedite the process and ensure your case is prioritised.Banks and payment platforms have dispute resolution mechanisms in place. If the transaction was unauthorised, file a dispute with your bank. The bank might provisionally credit the disputed amount back to your account while the investigation is ongoing. Providing detailed information and documentation can help your case.If your bank's response is unsatisfactory, you can escalate the issue to the Banking Ombudsman. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) offers this service to address grievances related to banking services. Filing a complaint with the Ombudsman can bring additional scrutiny and pressure on the bank to resolve your issue.Activate SMS and email alerts for all transactions on your bank accounts and cards. This feature allows you to detect unauthorised activity immediately and take swift action to prevent further fraud.Setting daily or per-transaction limits on your cards and UPI accounts can minimise potential losses if your account is compromised. Most banks offer this service through their mobile apps or online banking platforms.Two-factor authentication (2FA) enhances the security of your online transactions by adding an additional layer of protection. Enabling 2FA makes it harder for fraudsters to access your accounts, even if they have your password.Reviewing your bank and card statements regularly helps spot unauthorised transactions early. Immediate detection can prevent further fraud and make it easier to recover lost funds.Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or phone calls asking for your banking details. Always confirm the legitimacy of such communications before replying.
