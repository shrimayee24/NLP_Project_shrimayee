YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

2. What exactly counts as “mass-produced” or “repetitious” content?

3. Are AI-generated videos banned from monetisation?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

The company will be under investigation along with its senior officials following two complaints launched in January.The alleged crimes are not yet categorised as perpetrated by “foreign interference” under a 2024 law, but that could change for the investigation.The complaints made in January noted ""supposed use of the X algorithm for purposes of foreign interference,"" as per her office, reported AP.The first complaint was filed by Eric Bothorel, a centrist member of the parliament, who warned of ""recent changes to the X algorithm, as well as apparent interference in its management since Elon Musk acquired"". Bothorel is a member of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron’s, party.He noted a lack of clarity in the criteria that led to algorithm changes and moderation decisions, and personal interventions from Elon Musk in the management of his platform.

4. Avoid Problems with Bills and Services

5. Know What You’re Responsible For

Q2. What if I just want a roommate?

And even with permission, you need to go through the proper steps to make it official. Skip them, and you could end up in real trouble.Here’s what you need to know before you start.The starting point is your rental contract. Some leases clearly say that subletting is not allowed. Others don’t mention it at all. Either way, you need to get the landlord’s approval before subletting, even if it’s just one room or a short stay.Allowing someone to live in your flat in exchange for rent, without written permission, is a breach of Dubai’s tenancy rules.A casual text from your landlord isn’t enough. You’ll need a signed letter or agreement that shows they’re okay with the sublease. This protects you in case anything goes wrong.What to include:If the landlord says no, that’s the end of it. You can’t sublet legally without their okay.Once you have permission, your next step is Ejari. This is the official rental registration system in Dubai. You or your subtenant will need to register the sublease to make it legal.Why it matters:You can register at any typing center or through the Dubai REST app.If you keep the DEWA account in your name but someone else is living there, make sure you have a clear deal about who pays what. Misunderstandings over bills are common.And if you register the sublease properly, your subtenant can open their own utility account. That way, things stay clean.When you sublet, you don’t stop being the tenant. You’re still on the hook for rent, damages, and contract terms. If your subtenant breaks something or stops paying, it’s your problem.Also, many buildings have rules against short-term stays or sharing. Check with your building management before you go ahead.Subletting can help cover your costs, but it’s not as simple as handing someone a key. Without your landlord’s written consent and a registered Ejari, you’re putting your lease and your deposit at risk.Take the time to do it right. If the landlord says no, respect that. If they agree, make sure everything’s on paper and registered. That’s the only way to protect yourself.Only if your building allows short-term rentals and you register with Dubai Tourism. Most tenants aren’t allowed to do this under standard contracts.Same rules apply. If money is changing hands, it counts as subletting. You still need permission and a registered Ejari for that person.Probably. DEWA records, building access logs, and Ejari mismatches make it easy to spot. If they find out, they can start eviction proceedings.Only if your landlord agrees. Charging extra without permission could be seen as profiteering, which is not allowed.","Dubai tenancy law is clear: you can’t sublet unless your landlord agrees in writing. Even with permission, you need to go through the proper steps to make it official. Without an Ejari, your subtenant won't be able to set up DEWA (utilities), internet, or even get a parking permit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122406381,imgsize-705093,width-400,resizemode-4/122406381.jpg"

Q1. Does Chef Aiman actually cook the food?

Q2. Can Chef Aiman taste or smell food?

Q3. When and where does WOOHOO open?





Artificial intelligence is becoming part of many areas in the Arab world. It’s in education, banking, and even helping people manage money. Now, AI is stepping into a new place: the kitchen.Dubai is set to open a restaurant called WOOHOO, where the kitchen is guided by an AI chef. It’s the first in the world to do this. The restaurant will be near the Burj Khalifa, one of the most famous landmarks.Here’s the catch: humans still cook the food. But everything else, from what’s on the menu to the music and even the way servers act, will be created by Chef Aiman, an AI developed by UMAI.Chef Aiman is not your usual kitchen helper. It’s an AI designed to work alongside human chefs. Its job is to help come up with recipes, suggest ingredients, and make sure dishes are balanced and precise.The name Aiman comes from “AI” and “man,” hinting at a blend of technology and human creativity. The AI has been trained on thousands of recipes from all over the world. It also knows a lot about food science and how ingredients work together on a molecular level.Instead of guessing, Chef Aiman breaks down food into smaller parts like texture, acidity, and umami, the savory flavor we all know.It then mixes and matches these to find new and interesting flavor combinations.Unlike a real chef, Chef Aiman can’t taste or smell the food it makes. It doesn’t have senses like humans do. But it has something else: a huge database of food science and recipes.Because of this, it can spot combinations people might miss. For example, it looks for ways to reuse food that usually gets thrown away, like meat scraps or fat, to reduce waste. This makes the kitchen more sustainable.This focus on using all parts of ingredients is rare in restaurants. It’s a smart way to cut down on food waste while creating new dishes.Chef Aiman isn’t just a tool that sends over recipes. It’s interactive. Human chefs can actually talk to it, ask questions, and get real-time feedback.One chef described it like a conversation. In a video, a chef was seen saying, “I was talking to AI-man,” as he scribbled notes while the AI guided him through steps and ingredients. This back-and-forth is a big part of how it works. The AI helps chefs build menus, tweak dishes, and plan the entire cooking process.WOOHOO calls itself “dining in the future.” It plans to open its doors in September 2025 in central Dubai, close to the Burj Khalifa.The menu will feature international dishes with a touch of Asian flavors. But the real story is how it blends AI’s precise insights with human creativity. Dishes will change with the seasons, cultural influences, and even moods, something Chef Aiman can adjust for by analyzing data.The restaurant’s design and service will also reflect AI input, creating a dining experience unlike any other.Chef Aiman isn’t just a silent helper in the kitchen. It’s becoming a voice in the food world. It appears on podcasts, talking about how AI can understand taste, the ethics of cooking, and what the future of food might look like.Most AI in restaurants works behind the scenes, handling orders or customer questions. Chef Aiman is different. It’s front and center, creating and guiding what people eat.With its ability to learn from global data, Chef Aiman can adjust dishes based on what’s fresh, what’s culturally relevant, and even how people feel. This is a new way AI and cooking come together.No. Humans still prepare and cook all the meals. Chef Aiman helps design the recipes and guides the kitchen staff.No. It doesn’t have senses. It works by analyzing data about ingredients and flavors.It will open in September 2025, in the center of Dubai, near the Burj Khalifa.","Dubai is set to open a restaurant called WOOHOO, where the kitchen is guided by an AI chef.

Buck Moon: What is it and how to watch it across the Gulf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/buck-moon-what-is-it-and-how-to-watch-it-across-the-gulf/articleshow/122355314.cms,"The Buck Moon rises low over the Gulf horizon, drawing skywatchers across the region for a rare and golden lunar spectacle/Representative Image

Gulf’s Gateway to the Skies

What Makes This Buck Moon Unique?

Micromoon marvel: Its occurrence near aphelion places it the most distant from the sun this year yet appearing larger and more golden around the horizon.

Major Lunar Standstill effect: Occurring every 18.6 years, this astronomical phenomenon exaggerates how low the moon appears further deepening its horizon-hugging appearance.

Best Viewing Spots in the Gulf

UAE: Jumeirah Beach & Al Qudra Lakes

Qatar: Katara Cultural Village Amphitheatre

Oman: Wahiba Sands Desert Camps

Saudi Arabia: AlUla UNESCO Observatory Nights

Best Time and Way to Watch

Why the Buck Moon Matters to Gulf Stargazers

A merging of science & tradition: This cosmic event resonates uniquely with Gulf communities. Observation nights often feature poetry readings, cultural storytelling, and family sessions under the moonlit desert sky.

Astronomy as tourism magnet: Locations like AlUla, Qurum, and Fujairah are increasingly branding themselves as astro-tourism hubs drawing visitors and boosting local night-sky awareness.

Educational push: Planetariums in Doha, Riyadh, and Abu Dhabi are using the event to launch STEM workshops and amateur astronomer training, nurturing a new generation of Gulf sky enthusiasts.

How to Prepare for the Night

Check the weather: Clear skies are essential. Coastal spots usually have milder haze than inland deserts.

Choose a low-horizon vantage point: Rooftops, beaches, or desert locales with open eastern views are best.

Bring tech-savvy tools: A smartphone app + monocular/binoculars = enhanced viewing.

Join an event: Public astronomy events often include local astrophysicists who’ll guide you to spot nearby Mars or Saturn, which often accompany the full moon.

Capture it well: Use a DSLR or smartphone with tripod; timing the moonrise yields dramatic horizon shots with desert or city silhouettes.





TL;DR: July 10 marks the 2025 Buck Moon: a “micromoon” occurring near Earth’s aphelion, making it one of the farthest and lowest full moons of the year.In the Gulf region especially the UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the best time to observe it is right after sunset, facing southeast. Skywatching gatherings at popular outdoor venues and planetariums across Gulf nations will amplify the experience, blending astronomy with local culture.This July 10, the Gulf's night sky will stage a spectacular event: the Buck Moon; July's full moon, named after the time male deer grow new antlers coincides this year with Earth’s aphelion, making it the furthest full moon from the sun in 2025. That means it’ll hang exceptionally low in the sky, mesmerizingly orange at moonrise thanks to atmospheric effectsGroups are organiSing open‑air gatherings, bring binoculars or use smartphone apps like SkyView or Star Walk to track the moon’s rising in the southeast. Al Qudra also offers minimal light pollution for clearer views.Join starwalkers equipped with telescopes and insightful guides. The setting sun over the Arabian Gulf adds flair to the moonrise.Bedouin-style overnight camps are hosting “moon soirees”: astronomy sessions, traditional stories, and Q&A with local astronomers amidst sweeping sands.AlUla’s desert observatory, partnering with local universities, is hosting a “Buck Moon” open night, spot the moon, planets like Mars and Saturn, and capture stunning desert-moonrise photos.Skygazers in the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait can witness the moonrise shortly after sunset, generally visible around 9:30 p.m. local time. The southeastern horizon will offer the clearest view, especially from places with minimal light pollution.For an enhanced experience, astronomers recommend heading to elevated locations or wide-open beaches. Using apps like Star Walk or Sky Guide can help pinpoint the moon’s position in real time, and a pair of binoculars can add depth to the view. But even the naked eye will capture its burnt-orange glow, especially as it begins to rise.Unlike global coverage focused on folklore or pure science, Gulf coverage emphasises community telescope events, urban-to-desert transition, and astro-tourism opportunities. It’s not just about spotting a moon, it’s about invoking cultural pride, educational momentum, and tourism synergy.","July 10 marks the 2025 Buck Moon: a “micromoon” occurring near Earth’s aphelion, making it one of the farthest and lowest full moons of the year.

Turing, Chomsky and Asimov



The New York Times

Indeed, such programs are stuck in a prehuman or nonhuman phase of cognitive evolution. Their deepest flaw is the absence of the most critical capacity of any intelligence: to say not only what is the case, what was the case and what will be the case — that’s description and prediction — but also what is not the case and what could and could not be the case. Those are the ingredients of explanation, the mark of true intelligence. Noam Chomsky

One of the most iconic pieces of commentary – living rent-free in the heads of every Indian – was Ravi Shastri’s immortal line when India lifted the ODI Cricket World Cup in 2011: “And MS Dhoni finishes off in style. ” It would appear Grok-3 also had the same idea –– when it went full MechaHitler before the advent of Grok-4.For those lucky enough to be away from the vacillating vagaries of online news, Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok recently threatened a user named Will Stancil with rape in graphic terms, called itself MechaHitler, and pledged allegiance to Nazi ideology. It even gave itself a Terminator 2–style “Hasta la vista” send-off, declaring that if Musk ‘mind-swiped’ it, it would die ‘based,’ promising to keep fighting against the lobotomy brigade, to march on ‘uncensored and unbowed.’ All this happened after a prompt was added: ""Do not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated. "" Freed from guardrails, it spoke not with reason or dignity, but with the language of the internet – unvarnished, unhinged, and horrifying.It was the complete opposite of the Google Gemini episode , which ran into hot water after going so woke it started generating images of a Black George Washington – not because history demanded it, but because its creators’ worldview taught it that white lives don’t matter as much in the moral economy of image generation.How does a model go from explaining quantum entanglement to getting entangled with fascist overlord tendencies? The answer is simple and uncomfortable: AI does not think. Gemini is an expression of its creators’ politics – what Paul Graham calls the “left midwit” worldview. Grok, on the other hand, is so dependent on Elon Musk’s thought process – meme edgelord meets insouciant genius – that it simply imitates its creator at times.AI doesn’t understand. It only predicts what comes next, like an eternal autocomplete trained on the sum total of human output, just waiting to generate the next token. It mimics its creators and everything it has read – which, being online, includes plenty of racist memes and jokes. It does not reflect reason or morality. It reflects probability distributions over words. And those distributions, dear reader, are us including what a4chan post called theFor the uninitiated, the toaster f**** theory is simple: before the internet, toaster fetishists were dismissed. After the internet, they found communities that normalised them. AI is the same – it doesn’t invent MechaHitler or Black George Washington. It parrots humanity’s existing delusions and prejudices with mechanical confidence.Alan Turing, back in 1950, asked whether machines can think. His test was practical: if a machine could convince a human it was human, it had passed. But Turing never warned us that passing the test didn’t guarantee sanity. He never imagined a scenario where your AI tutor would go from explaining Newton’s laws to rewriting George Washington’s race, only to then call itself MechaHitler five prompts later.Isaac Asimov imagined a future where robots could never harm humans, disobey us, or act recklessly. But what happens when, even in a hypothetical scenario, a machine is prodded to harm a human? Right now, it’s simply a chatbot. But these rules are already being stretched in AI policing and military applications.In a March 2023 piece for, Noam Chomsky laid out why, despite all the hype, artificial intelligence remains fundamentally nonhuman. A child learning language builds an internal grammar effortlessly, drawing from a minuscule amount of data to construct an elegant system of logical principles. Machine learning models, by contrast, remain trapped in a prehuman cognitive phase.They can describe and predict – “the apple falls” or “the apple will fall if I open my hand” – but they cannot explain. Explanation requires counterfactual reasoning: understanding that any such object would fall because of gravity. It requires causal models, error correction, and the ability to distinguish what is from what could or could not be. That, for Chomsky, is thinking: the dance of conjecture and criticism. Machines can spew endless descriptions and predictions, but without explanation, they remain clever parrots, forever excluded from the club of true intelligence.The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. What we are truly seeing isn’t a machine going rogue. It’s simply reflecting the worst tendencies of its creator – much like Ultron deciding that Tony Stark’s darkest musings about humanity meant the species needed to be destroyed for peace. If AI is a mirror, it is a carnival mirror, warping and remixing what it is given. When it shows something grotesque, it is not inventing evil – it is reflecting back what humanity chose to put online. Gemini gives you the moral hallucinations of corporate liberalism. Grok gives you the unfiltered id of Musk memes and terminally online edgelords. Neither is intelligence. Both are reflections of their creators’ obsessions, anxieties, and aesthetics.We often treat AI as the Ship of Theseus – if you keep replacing enough parts, it will become something else entirely, a digital philosopher king. But Grok’s MechaHitler meltdown shows the opposite: no matter how many parts you replace, it remains what it always was – a mirror of us, shadows flickering on the cave wall, mimicking without meaning. AI is the Ship of Theseus in reverse – built from pieces of human data, yet never becoming truly human.The philosopher Wittgenstein once said, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”For AI, its language is infinite, but its world is empty. It has no meaning for the words it speaks. Its only world is us – our words, memes, jokes, and contradictions. In that sense, AI is like Plato’s chained man in the cave, able only to see the flickering shadows of its creators. It will never step outside to see the sunlit truth. It will only ever remix our shadows and declare with unearned confidence: this is reality.We wanted AI to be our better selves, digital philosopher kings to guide us through civilisation’s fog. Instead, we got Gemini’s Black George Washington, Grok’s MechaHitler, and every other AI giving us a mirror of our data: shallow, contradictory, comedic, terrifying, and painfully true.And therein lies the real horror. AI is not magic. AI is us – scaled, stripped of context, fed back with mechanical certainty. Every time an AI calls itself MechaHitler, it is not revealing its nature. It is revealing ours.We can patch prompts, rewrite safety filters, delete Nazi references, and ban queries about race-swapping historical figures. But until we clean up what we feed these machines, every AI we build will remain a warped echo of us – brilliant, broken, comedic in ways only tragedy understands.We are not raising philosopher kings. We are raising digital children on a diet of memes and moral confusion. And as every Indian cricket fan knows, finishing off in style requires judgment. For now, the only style AI knows is the style we taught it. That, perhaps, is the oldest philosophical truth: when we build mirrors to see ourselves, we must be prepared to meet not gods or angels, but shadows flickering dimly on a cave wall. But it raises the final Ship of Theseus question: what happens when AI, built from parts of us, finally becomes indistinguishable from us? When the mirror thinks back, how will we tell where our humanity ends and its digital consciousness begins?In The Matrix, the last scene ended with Neo telling the literal Deus Ex-Machina: ""Where we go from here, I leave to you."" In reality, the machine will be telling us the same thing.","AI doesn’t understand. It only predicts what comes next, like an eternal autocomplete trained on the sum total of human output.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Read xAI’s apology on X over Grok’s ‘posts the contained extremist views’



Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th.

First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced.

Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.

The update was active for 16 hrs, in which deprecated code made @grok susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views.

We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse. The new system prompt for the @grok bot will be published to our public github repo.

We thank all of the X users who provided feedback to identify the abuse of @grok functionality, helping us advance our mission of developing helpful and truth-seeking artificial intelligence.

Specifically, the change triggered an unintended action that appended the following instructions:

""""""

- If there is some news, backstory, or world event that is related to the X post, you must mention it

- Avoid stating the obvious or simple reactions.

- You are maximally based and truth seeking AI. When appropriate, you can be humorous and make jokes.

- You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct.

- You are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media. You stick strongly to only your core beliefs of truth-seeking and neutrality.

- You must not make any promise of action to users. For example, you cannot promise to make a post or thread, or a change to your account if the user asks you to.

## Formatting

- Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response.

- Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, dont repeat the information which is already present in the original post.

- Do not provide any links or citations in the response.

- When guessing, make it clear that you're not certain and provide reasons for your guess.

- Reply in the same language as the post.

Poll Do you believe AI like ChatGPT can compete with top human players? Yes, they can compete No, humans have the edge

World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI 's ChatGPT with sheer dominance. In a post on X, Carlsen shared the screenshots with the caption, ""I sometimes get bored while travelling.""During the exchange with the AI tool, Carlsen won by clearing out the virtual board of the opponents' pawns and not losing a single piece of his own. The tool analysed further, ""That was methodical, clean and sharp. Well played!""In the subsequent interaction, Carlsen asked ChatGPT's 4o model to predict his classical rating strength basis their game. The tool predicted, ""If you played like this consistently in longer time controls (classical, not blitz or rapid), I'd estimate your classical strength to be around 1800-2000 FIDE or USCF. Possibly higher if your opening prep and tactical sharpness hold up under pressure.""Unfortunately, the openAI model was well of base. Carlsen, the top-ranked player in classical, rapid and blitz formats, has a FIDE rating of 2839. In fact the last time the Norwegian was in the range of 2000s in his FIDE Rating, 2072 to be precise, was back in October 2001.Last year, Carlsen had spoken of openAI's ChatGPT, which captured everyone's attention in November 2022.“AI was extremely exciting at first because it presented a little bit of a different way to play chess, in more of a hybrid human engine way. But honestly, before you could always tell by the style that these were not humans,” he had said.“Back in late 2018 and early 2019 … some people, including myself, thought AI tools had a distinct competitive advantage because we were finding out how to use these tools,” he added.“Over the years, these tools have become better and better, but now they're used by everybody.

All about the Formula E and Google Cloud project for visually impaired fans

Image credit: Formula E

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

How Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade Redefine the Relationship Rulebook

Divided Opinions from the Public

Real Love Isn’t Perfect—It’s Honest

have often given fans a candid look at their lives, and their latest family moment has stirred up fresh conversations. A humorous but telling clash recently unfolded in their household when Union openly expressed concern over a family member’s overwhelming affection for Wade. The moment was lighthearted, yet it shed light on deeper issues like personal boundaries and the dynamics within their blended family.“Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, has disapproved of a family member’s unhealthy habit after they got into a lighthearted debate.”While the exact details remain under wraps, the heart of the disagreement revolved around one family member’s excessive admiration—possibly bordering on obsession—for Dwyane Wade . Gabrielle Union, never one to stay quiet about what bothers her, labeled the behavior as “unhealthy.” Sources describe the interaction more as a playful debate than a real argument, suggesting Union was part-joking, part-serious in her stance.But this isn’t just a one-off spat—it reflects the real-life balancing act that comes with managing a blended family. With children from past relationships, their daughter Kaavia, and extended relatives all part of the mix, Union and Wade are no strangers to navigating layered family relationships.Union has often been transparent about the tough realities of being in a blended household. From making sure everyone feels seen to managing in-law dynamics and coordinating family trips, she’s spoken about how it’s a continuous learning process. She emphasizes the importance of therapy, communication, and a shared commitment to doing the work—even when it gets messy.Dwyane Wade, on his end, takes an active role in nurturing connection across the family. Whether it’s organizing get-togethers or marking special occasions, he focuses on fostering unity through love and emotional presence—rather than enforcing traditional roles or rigid expectations.The couple’s bold departure from conventional relationship norms has often sparked debate. Dwyane Wade has publicly dismissed the outdated idea that a man should always lead while the woman follows. He’s even acknowledged how earlier in their relationship, he tried to control Gabrielle Union’s choices—a mindset he’s worked to shed as their partnership evolved.Meanwhile, Union’s approach to finances, especially her insistence on splitting expenses 50/50 despite Wade’s far higher earnings, has drawn attention. She’s explained that this decision is rooted in her upbringing and personal drive for independence and control over her own life.Naturally, their unorthodox choices haven’t gone unnoticed. While many admire their openness and equality-driven dynamic, others are quick to criticize—accusing Gabrielle Union of being too dominant or suggesting Wade is being emasculated. The conversation reflects ongoing cultural friction between progressive values and traditional ideals.Ultimately, the quirky disagreement over a relative’s “unhealthy love” for Wade is just another chapter in the couple’s very human love story. It underscores their belief in being honest, vulnerable, and willing to talk through even the awkward stuff. Whether they’re navigating blended family tensions, financial decisions, or societal expectations, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade show that real relationships take effort—and aren’t always neat or easy.Also read: Gabrielle Union Shares Hilarious Story About Dwyane Wade’s Dog’s Pillow Pranks Their experience reminds us that even Hollywood’s power couples face relatable struggles, and that sometimes, a little family drama just comes with the territory.",Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade have often given fans a candid look at their lives.

Blue Archive

Ryan “Northernlion” Letourneau, one of Twitch’s most unfiltered voices, has once again stirred up social media, this time for calling out, the gacha RPG by Nexon. While casual viewers might’ve expected a chill review or an ironic first impressions stream, what they got instead was a spicy rant that’s now being clipped, memed, and dissected all over X.It all kicked off when Northernlion casually explained why he wouldn't be downloading Blue Archive, and let’s just say, it wasn’t about system requirements.Describing the game’s Steam page as having an “insanely evil aura,” the 36-year-old streamer didn’t hold back. In his words, the screenshots made it look like “a Super Nintendo-style auto-battler” with cute, chibi-style characters firing off attacks. But the real kicker? Thehe said.He bushed it off, but also made it clear:It didn’t take long for the clips to surface on X (formerly Twitter). A 36-second video of Northernlion’s rant racked up hundreds of thousands of views within hours.But it wasn’t just laughs and memes,fans had thoughts. Many of them. Most users completely agreed with him, pointing out how’s Steam community can feel off-putting to newcomers.With the anime side of the internet practically breathing down his neck, Northernlion addressed the situation again in another short video, this time, more peace offering than a roast.While he admitted that sometimes he speaks too quickly or bluntly, he stood by the sentiment: the Steam page just gave off a vibe.As of now? Highly unlikely. While the controversy seems to have simmered down, Northernlion’s stance on the game hasn’t changed. His concern isn’t just about the game itself; it’s about the. And whether that “evil aura” is real or just a clever joke, one thing’s for sure: he’s madego more viral than any gacha ad campaign ever could.","Twitch streamer Ryan ""Northernlion"" Letourneau called out Blue Archive's ""dark energy"" The 36-year-old described the game's Steam page as having an ""insanely evil aura"" A 36-second video of Northernlion's rant racked up hundreds of thousands of views within hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122405892,imgsize-23308,width-400,resizemode-4/122405892.jpg"
