What is TikTok's 'Gen Z boss and a mini' trend? Why is it facing backlash?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-tiktoks-gen-z-boss-and-a-mini-trend-why-is-it-facing-backlash/articleshow/111758680.cms,"A video posted by TBH Skincare on social media platforms has sparked a heated debate about the behaviour of Gen Z and the concept of ""cringe."" The clip features a group of young women dancing and chanting in their office, taking turns to describe their characteristics, inspired by the recent ""boots and a slicked back bun"" meme that originated on TikTok .Despite its intention as a lighthearted and enjoyable activity, the "" Gen Z boss and a mini "" meme faced significant criticism when it spread to corporate accounts. Online commentators labelled the video as ""cringe"". Whereas, the ""corporate"" used it to satirise the forced ""fun activities"" that often occur at work events.As the video gained popularity, some commentators suggested that it represented the decline of Gen Z, implying that they had succumbed to the same cringe-worthy behaviour they had previously mocked millennials for. Millennials have often been the target of Gen Z's ridicule, portrayed as overly sincere and obsessed with pop culture phenomena like Harry Potter, Taylor Swift, and The Office.Moreover, the negative reaction to the video took a misogynistic turn as it spread to the ""manosphere,"" an online space where toxic masculinity and the categorisation of men into ""alphas,"" ""betas,"" and ""sigmas"" are prevalent. The intense criticism led the women in the original video to post a follow-up, in which they danced and chanted to the tune of the negative comments they had received.The viral spread of the ""Gen Z boss and a mini"" video briefly shed light on the complex and often troubling dynamics of gender and generational divides on the internet.","The viral spread of the ""Gen Z boss and a mini"" video briefly shed light on the complex and often troubling dynamics of gender and generational divides on the internet.

How digital threads are weaving future of fashion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/how-digital-threads-are-weaving-future-of-fashion/articleshow/111796993.cms,"Fashion is undergoing a digital renaissance

Fashion is undergoing a digital renaissance. From smart fabrics to AI-driven design , cutting-edge innovations are transforming how clothes are created, marketed, and consumed.“We’re witnessing a 360-degree transformation,” says Sharmila Senthilraja, industry platform leader for consumer products and retail at Capgemini India. “Whether you look at the front of the house, where consumers interact with brands, or the back of the house, where products are made, it’s completely digitalised.”This digital shift is dramatically accelerating the fashion lifecycle.Where it once took 9-12 months to bring a new collection to market, brands can now go from concept to consumer in just 2-3 weeks. This compression is driven by technologies like 3D design tools, AI-powered trend forecasting, and agile manufacturing processes.The retail experience is evolving just as rapidly. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are allowing shoppers to “try on” clothes digitally, both online and in stores. Smart mirrors and interactive fitting rooms are enhancing the in-store experience, while seamless omnichannel integration is blurring the lines between physical and digital shopping.“Post-Covid, we’re seeing a surge in both online commerce and physical stores,” notes Senthilraja. “It’s a hybrid world now. People start their journeys online and go offline, or from offline to online. The challenge is putting that shopping journey together seamlessly.”Personalisation has become a key battleground, as retailers leverage vast troves of customer data to tailor recommendations and experiences. “If you can identify the right personalisation for the customer, they will become loyal to you,” says Nikil Jain, head of product at Ajio, an Indian fashione-commerce platform. “That’s the only way to retain customers on the platform right now.”However, fashion personalisation presents unique challenges. “Even your best friend or sibling might have a very different fashion sense,” Jain points out. Effective personalisation must account for body shape, style preferences, brand affinities, colour palettes, and more.To tackle this complexity, fashion retailers are investing heavily in data science and analytics. They’re combining explicit user inputs, product reviews, and implicit behavioural data to build increasingly sophisticated recommendation engines. Some are even creating “digital DNA” profiles of customers to predict preferences and tailor experiences.As exciting as these innovations are, they also raise concerns about data privacy. With regulations like Europe’s GDPR and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act tightening the screws on data collection and usage, retailers and tech companies will need to find new ways to personalise experiences while respecting consumer privacy.Sustainability is another major driver of innovation in the fashion industry. “Fashion is the poster child of one of the most polluting industries,” says Senthilraja. To address this, brands are exploring eco-friendly materials, bioethical fabrics, and more efficient production methods.Technology is playing a crucial role in these sustainability efforts. AI and automation are helping to reduce waste by enabling on-demand production and more accurate demand forecasting. Digital sampling and 3D design tools are cutting down on physical prototypes. Blockchain and IoT sensors are improving supply chain transparency and traceability.“We have gone one step ahead and created a generative AI platform,” says Kavita Jha, CEO of KiksAR Technologies. That platform enables virtual sampling and 3D product visualisation that could dramatically reduce waste and returns in the fashion industry.Industry experts see several transformative trends on the horizon. Voice commerce, powered by natural language processing, could make shopping as simple as a conversation. Advanced 3D printing might allow for hyper-personalised, on-demand clothing production. Some even envision a future where digital fashion becomes as important as physical clothing.“I imagine a world which has got no materials, everything is technology,” muses Sibichan K Mathew, professor of fashion management studies at NIFT, Delhi. He envisions wearable devices that could project different colours and patterns onto the body, creating a constantly changing, customisable wardrobe without physical garments.The future of fashion promises to be as much about bits and bytes as it is about fabric and thread. For fashion brands and retailers, keeping up with this technological revolution could be a matter of survival.","Fashion is undergoing a digital renaissance.

Barron Trump Height: How tall is Barron Trump? What is his height?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-tall-is-barron-trump-what-is-his-height/articleshow/111610554.cms,"Former President Donald Trump, center right, stands with his wife Melania, second left, their son Barron, center left, and father-in-law Viktor Knavs, as the coffin carrying the remains of Amalija Knavs, the former first lady's mother, is carried into the Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea for her funeral, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla.

How tall is he exactly?

Is he the tallest child of a US President?

Where is he going to college?

Barron Trump , the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height. Photographed at his maternal grandmother’s funeral recently, the now-17-year-old's stature was striking, highlighting just how much he has grown. For those who haven't been following Barron closely, this recent appearance might come as a surprise, prompting comments like, “Man, that kid shot up like a weed!”The exact height of Barron Trump is a topic of some debate, even within his own family.Donald Trump has mentioned different figures, claiming at various times that Barron is either 6 feet, 7 inches or 6 feet, 8 inches tall. This variation might be due to differences in measurement methods, but it’s also notable given Donald Trump's history of exaggerating his own height. Whether he’s boasting, downplaying, or genuinely uncertain about Barron’s height, the fact remains that Barron is exceptionally tall.Given his impressive stature, Barron might hold a unique place in history as the tallest child of a U.S. president. Historically, presidential children’s heights were not meticulously recorded, making it difficult to confirm if Barron holds the record. For instance, while Abraham Lincoln was the tallest president at 6 feet, 4 inches, there is little information about the height of his son, Robert Lincoln. Similarly, no records detail the heights of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s sons or other presidential offspring. Peter Kastor, a professor specializing in presidential history at Washington University in St. Louis, notes that records of presidents' heights are sparse, let alone those of their children.Reports on Donald Trump’s reaction to Barron’s height are mixed. Trump's frequent mentions of Barron’s height suggest a sense of pride. For example, when discussing Barron’s recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, Trump affectionately referred to him as “My Barron. My tall Barron. He’s very tall. My beautiful Barron.” However, there are also anecdotes suggesting that Trump might feel some jealousy. Michael Wolff’s 2019 book mentions Trump being envious of Barron’s height when he was just 12 years old.Earlier reports suggested that Barron might attend the University of Pennsylvania, following in his father's footsteps at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. He was also considering New York University. However, a recent TikTok post indicates that Barron is keeping his options open and might even take a gap year, given the significant developments in his family's life. Donald Trump recently praised his son, saying, ""He's tall, good-looking... a very good student. He's applied to colleges and gets into everywhere he goes. He's very sought after because he's a very smart guy, a very tall guy, and a great kid.""","Barron Trump, the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height.

Limit management



New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4.

Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

How this technology may have helped FBI access locked phone of Trump's shooter in two days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-technology-may-have-helped-fbi-access-locked-phone-of-trumps-shooter-in-two-days/articleshow/111790317.cms,"What software helped FBI access the shooter’s phone

Previous phone-cracking incident

Two days after the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) announced that they had “gained access” to the shooter's phone. The agency did not reveal how they managed to break into the device or what information they discovered. However, the rapid success suggests the use of advanced phone-hacking tools .“FBI technical specialists successfully gained access to Thomas Matthew Crooks’ phone, and they continue to analyse his electronic devices,” the FBI said, without mentioning the name and model of the phone. The agency, however, failed in its first attempt to break into the shooter’s phone.According to a report by The Verge, when field agents in Pennsylvania failed to ‘crack’ the phone, the FBI sent it to its lab in Quantico, Virginia where they took the help of security researchers to break into the phone.The publication cited Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, saying that the law enforcement agencies possess tools to extract data from phones.“Almost every police department in the nation has a device called the Cellebrite , which is a device built for extracting data from phones, and it also has some capability to unlock phones,” Quintin was quoted as saying.Cellebrite, an Israel-based company, provides mobile device extraction tools (MDTFs) to law enforcement. The report noted that these tools come from various vendors and offer different capabilities for extracting data from mobile devices. Their efficacy – how well they work – can vary significantly. It's likely the FBI has its own internal forensics tools developed specifically for their needs.“It seems reasonable to me that the field office there [in Pennsylvania] wouldn’t have some of the more advanced techniques for breaking into modern phones that they have at Quantico,” Quintin said, adding that he had “little doubt that Quantico will be able to break into this phone”.In a previous case, the FBI had demanded that Apple unlock an iPhone of the shooter in the San Bernardino shooting case in 2016. However, the company refused, saying that it cannot create a backdoor.“The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. While we believe the FBI’s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at that time.The FBI later dropped the case because it got help from an “outside source” to break into the device.","Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that they had ‘gained access’ to the shooter’s phone.

Privacy on iPhone | Flock | Apple

Here’s how Safari addresses common tracking methods

Cross-site tracking prevention

Hides IP address from known trackers

Location data protections

Privacy-preserving web extensions

Blocks known trackers in Private Browsing

Removes unique trackers from URLs in Private Browsing

Apple is making a major push for user privacy with Safari browser. The company has detailed features that keeps users safe while they use Safari in their day to day life. For this, the company has launched a campaign highlighting six key areas where their browser protects user privacy. These include combating cross-site tracking , shielding location data, securing extensions, and offering enhanced Private Browsing with link protection.The campaign is launched as the Apple released iOS 18 public beta and macOS Sequoia public beta.Apple released a short video hinting at how web tracking works on browsers and how they may leave users vulnerable. It highlights that ‘other’ browsers follow users’ activity across websites, building a profile without their knowledge.They can expose location which means that data companies can pinpoint users’ location without permission. Not only websites, some extensions can access users’ data, compromising privacy. It also highlights that private browsing in other browsers may not fully protect users..Apple says with Safari, users get cross-site tracking blocked, essentially stopping companies from following them across the web. There’s location control where users decide when websites access their location. Thirdly, there is a choice of privacy-first extensions and finally, Safari offers advanced private browsing.Apple says that since the data companies are constantly evolving new techniques to track users, it created an Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature that uses machine learning to learn which domains are used to track users. It then isolates and purges the tracking data from the device. Intelligent Tracking Prevention is on by default when you use Safari.Safari also hides users’ IP address from known trackers. This is important because an IP address can be used to identify a user across websites and sessions, which can reveal the user’s precise location.Apple says Safari also combats fingerprinting – techniques to figure out who you are and where you browse. System configuration, fonts, plug-ins and even the screen resolution can be used as part of a fingerprint. A simplified version of the system configuration on Apple products makes it hard for trackers to single one out, it noted.Apple notes that Safari helps protect location data, which is another way that websites and data companies try to track users. To keep users in control, Safari does not share location data with any search engine. In cases where users need to provide location information, such as looking for places nearby, Safari gives users granular control by prompting ‘to share or not share’ data, or even choose “remember my decision for one day,"" to limit how long the website can use your location.Apple says that some extensions in other browsers can track what is on users’ screens. Safari, on the other hand, informs users about the information the extension can access before they enable it.Private Browsing in Safari doesn’t save the web pages that users have visited, the searches that have been made, or AutoFill information. Apple is also making these protections even stronger with Face ID and Touch ID.When users browse the web, they may notice that some links have added extra information to track you. Safari removes those links or unnecessary trackers appended to URLs that are shared in Messages and Mail, the company explained. This also works when browsing in Safari Private Browsing.","Apple is making a major push for user privacy with Safari browser.

Verdict

Motorola expanded its Edge series in India recently with the launch of Motorola Edge 50 Fusion . Over the years, Motorola’s Edge series smartphones have become popular for their design and performance in terms of camera and display. The Edge 50 Fusion is no exception. It features a vegan leather texture on the rear and premium-looking colours.The smartphone runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor and comes with a starting price of Rs 22,999 (base variant).Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs a host of features like Dolby Atmos surround sound, AI-powered shot optimization and audio zoom. We used the device for sometime and here’s our reviewWith the vegan leather back, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gives a premium tactile experience. The smartphone is offered in three colour options – Forest Blue, Marshmallow Blue and Hot Pink. We got the Marshmallow Blue variant for review which looks good and further adds to the premiumness of the device.The leather back gives a sturdy hand grip of the Edge 50 Fusion without worrying for any scratches and dust. Motorola ships a pantone inspired cover with the phone. While Motorola provides a complimentary back cover, it's worth noting that it might slightly affect the phone's grip and feel.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes with curved edges on the front. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically. The LED flash light is placed beside the sensors.Weighing 175 grams, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a comparatively lightweight device. Left edge of the phone features three buttons – volume increase and decrease button placed above the power button. The bottom edge houses the Type-C port along with speakers, microphone and SIM tray slot.Overall, the smartphone looks premium for its price with a subtle design and colour. Having said that, we recommend using a back cover with the phone as it tends to get dirty easily.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. The display is good with satisfactory colour production. However, the display lacks support for HDR. Nevertheless, the viewing experience is decent with deep contrast and punchy colours.The smartphone features adaptive brightness and adjusts itself as per the surrounding light. We did not face any issue while using the phone outdoors. Another feature worthy of mentioning is the edge lighting on Motorola Edge 50 Fusion that lights up the edges while receiving a notification or a call.The handset is also equipped with another feature called flicker prevention. Enabling it prevents the screen from flickering in dark environments. The phone is said to offer up to 600 nits of peak brightness which can be adjusted as well.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset with 4nm process. The smartphone has an octa-core CPU with four high-performance Arm Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.4Ghz speed. It is paired with four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores at a clock speed of 1.95GHz. For graphics, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has Adreno 710 GPU. The device was able to efficiently handle day-to-day tasks. We did not face any noticeable lag in the daily performance of the device. The handset can handle moderate gaming, though it tends to heat up during prolonged gaming sessions.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs up to 12GB RAM and up to 256GB internal storage capacity. The smartphone runs on Android 14 based Motorola’s Hello UI skin on the top. The phone has a comparatively clean UI with no third-party apps. Although you will find some Motorola’s own system apps. The company is giving three major Android OS updates with the phone in addition to four years of security patch, which is good if you are looking to buy a smartphone for prolonged years.One thing that got us worried was that the display, at times, does not immediately wake up when tapped on the locked screen.Coming to the audio of the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, we really liked the sound quality. Equipped with Dolby Atmos surround sound, it manages to deliver an immersive audio experience. The handset also boasts of Spatial Audio which works with compatible media contents only. Users can also customize the audio settings for music, gaming, movies or podcasts. There is also a smart audio feature that identifies the content and performs automatic adjustments. You can also connect your smartphone to your TV and select advanced settings for the connected device.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion also has a Live Caption feature. Once enabled, it can detect speech on the device and automatically generate captions. The feature is available with a software update.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a dual camera setup on the back. There is a 50MP Sony Lytia700 C main sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide secondary sensor. During our review, we found the images to be slightly oversaturated with enhanced colours and contrast. Images captured using the phone are generally warm with a yellowish tint.The main sensor supports optical image stabilization (OIS) which reduces motion blur in the images. Photos captured in low-light are decent. There is enough detail in the image without any unnecessary noise.The 13MP ultra-wide camera gives a satisfactory performance in capturing wide-angle shots. For selfies and video calls, the phone has a 32MP camera at the front with f/2.4 aperture. Selfies captured by Motorola Edge 50 Fusion are good. The images do not look artificial. There is a slight skin tone correction, but not to the extent that it deviates from reality. The phone struggles to capture photos in the indoor artificial lighting using the front camera. Though no such issue was faced for outdoor images.The UI of the camera app is easy to navigate through. Camera features like portrait, slow motion, Pro mode and others are available right on the screen. So you don’t have to struggle to find them. We noticed that there is a lack of depth in the portrait shots with not satisfactory image detection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is backed by a 5,000mAh battery. The company ships a 68watt charger inside the box with a USB Type-C to Type-C charging cable. The phone can easily last a full day easily on a single charge. It takes almost an hour to fully charge the device.Some of the battery features on the phone include adaptive battery that limit battery for apps that are not in use. There is also a charge boost that can optimize charging by increasing the charging speed. However, the phone tends to heat up with this feature. Battery safety features are optimized charging and overcharge protection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion delivers a striking balance between performance, camera and design. Packed with mid-range Snapdragon processor, Sony camera sensor and vegan leather back, the smartphone ticks most boxes. At Rs 22,999, the company has carved out a niche for Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, offering compelling features at an affordable price tag.",Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically.

The WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes is not only a prominent figure in wrestling but also gaining notable attention in pop culture. Cody's persona and the concept of the American Nightmare are frequently compared to Homelander from Prime's blockbuster show, The Boys. This comparison arises due to his attire and blonde hairstyle. Cody even appeared in a recent advertisement for The Boys , mimicking Homelander's dominating nature.However, Cody recently expressed his dislike for being compared to Homelander and clarified the concept behind his attire.In a recent interview on ""Insight with Chris Van Vliet,"" The American Nightmare shared his thoughts on Homelander. The WWE Champion clarified the inspiration behind his attire, stating, ""With all the love I have for 'The Boys,' and [Antony Starr's] performance as Homelander — the entire cast — and their production is first class, ... the robe is not based on it. The robe is based on military dress uniforms.""Cody emphasized that his robe is inspired by military uniforms, not Homelander's outfit. He praised the show andAntony Starr 's performance as Homelander but made it clear he does not endorse the character. Cody explained, ""I think the AEW run where people thought I [was] pretending to be a good guy but I'm actually a good guy, which maybe was what was happening — I think that's where it really became [like], 'He's gonna go full Homelander.' Truthfully, Homelander the character is a terrible human being."" (Credit: Insight with Chris Van Vliet/ Wrestling Inc)During the interview, Cody Rhodes shared his thoughts on a potential heel turn, similar to Homelander. He stated that he has no issues with it but emphasized that the company must carefully assess whether this is something only a vocal minority of fans want or if it is a desire shared by the broader WWE audience. In short, fans might witness a heel turn from Cody in the near future, but it will only happen if the majority of fans support it.Cody Rhodes is currently entangled in a storyline with The Bloodline members. The rivalry between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa is intensifying daily, and both are set to clash for the WWE Undisputed Championship at SummerSlam. Last week on SmackDown, Cody was brutally assaulted by The Bloodline members Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and the self-proclaimed Tribal Chief, Solo Sikoa. The members also viciously attacked Randy Orton, putting him through the announce table.
