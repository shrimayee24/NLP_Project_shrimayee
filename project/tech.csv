Shaunie Henderson and her husband Pastor Keion Henderson explain their successful marriage



Shaquille O'Neal ’s ex, Shaunie Henderson is happily married to Pastor Keion Henderson . The couple, who lead Houston’s Lighthouse Church and Ministries, have built a strong foundation by prioritizing their relationship amidst their busy lives. In a recent chat with Madame Noire, Shaunie, and Keion shared intricate details of their marriage and how they keep their relationship afloat with certain key pointers.As Pastor Keion Henderson explains, managing multiple responsibilities is essential. “We all have to manage multiple things,” he told Madame Noire. “You must manage yourself; if you have a significant other, you must manage that... Everybody has to be multi-faceted.”Outside influences don’t define their marriage. “We recognize that the Internet is not our relationship. The church is not our relationship. People’s opinions, they are not our relationship. We met each other. We chose this journey together and did what we had to stay on the original ship. We don’t let water in the ship,” Keion explains, adding that constant communication and grace are key to their success. Shaunie Henderson values advice from a trusted mentor who told her, “One of the things that I hold dear is that she says not to meet anyone’s expectations. Because once you meet one, there’ll be another one, and there’ll be another one after that, and you will never meet it and just be disappointing yourself and performing.”Defining marriage on their terms is crucial to the Hendersons. “Just because I’m a pastor and just because she’s a First Lady, that doesn’t mean that your faith isn’t tested,” Keion shares. “My definition of marriage is the collision of two histories… And sometimes compatibility isn’t the outcome.” They believe that open communication is essential. “We try to have a designated day that we sit down and talk, but with our life, travel, and schedule, that day and time can change,” Shaunie added.Knowing when to step away is another lesson they’ve learned in their marriage. “Our approach has been twofold. No. 1, communicate. No. 2, step away,” Keion reveals. “We’ll give each other some time to think about it and then come and talk.” Keion, author of Lazy Love: Recognizing and Reversing the 4 Threats to Any Successful Relationship, explains, “As I understand you, you understand me. I trust the outcomes that we both come away with… We always come together stronger than ever.”Faith remains the core of their union. “It is a must,” Shaunie asserts. “As women, we need to feel safe, and once you feel safe, you’re OK with being vulnerable… Having a spiritual component in your marriage is another layer of safety.” Keion adds that faith offers reassurance, saying, “I want folks to feel like they are overcomers… that they can manage their children and their businesses and their relationships.”Also Read: ""It's less physical"": Shaquille O'Neal weighs in on LeBron James' career amid injury controversy Shaunie was previously married to NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal. The former couple share four children together— sons Shareef and Shaqir, and daughters Amirah and Me'arah.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","The Ghibli-style photo trend is taking over social media.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Miyazaki’s films, especially those created under the Studio Ghibli banner, have garnered international acclaim and earned hundreds of millions in revenue. Notably, Spirited Away, which Miyazaki directed, became the highest-grossing Japanese film at the time of its release, earning over $275 million globally. Spirited Away, like other Ghibli productions, Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle, produced after it, cemented Studio Ghibli as an undisputed giant in the global animation market.Besides box office collections, Studio Ghibli has generated huge revenues from other sources like DVD sales, product merchandising, and streaming rights online. These revenues, in different forms, have provided the studio and its co-founder with enough ease to spend a couple of years in advance.OpenAI then made ChatGPT available with improved features to be optimized at producing images looking like a wide variety of styles, even the masterpieces of the great maestros such as Hayao Miyazaki. Social media was swamped all through the night with AI-created pieces of art chillingly similar to the vintage Studio Ghibli style. It has brought wonder and outrage in about equal proportions, with some fans welcoming the new styles of art, but others, even Miyazaki himself, being adamant in their refusal.Miyazaki has long been vocal about his distaste for artificial intelligence, referring to it as ""an insult to life itself."" His criticism stems from the belief that AI, despite its advanced capabilities, cannot replicate the true emotions and human experiences that underlie traditional animation. Miyazaki’s films, known for their emotional depth and intricate storytelling, are grounded in the human experience—something he feels AI cannot fully comprehend or replicate.""I was not able to sit here and have fun enjoying this sort of thing and having a good time,"" Miyazaki told an interviewer. ""The person who does so does not even realize what pain is. I am ill. If you want to make so many bad things, go ahead and make them. I would not even consider using this technology myself to such a degree.""This reflects his deep belief in the uniqueness of human creativity, which he feels AI lacks.As of 2025, the net worth of Hayao Miyazaki was estimated at $50 million, a huge amount of money within the animation industry. His riches are mostly gained from the financial success and worldwide popularity of Studio Ghibli. Although not as lucrative financially as big businesses like Disney, the financial success of Miyazaki is staggering considering other leaders in the field like Walt Disney or Nick Park.Studio Ghibli’s revenue is not limited to box office earnings alone; the studio’s ability to monetize its films through various media and product sales has contributed significantly to Miyazaki’s wealth. This enduring success has allowed him to remain one of the most financially successful figures in animation.Miyazaki’s films continue to be a significant cultural and financial force even years after their initial releases. Movies like Howl’s Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke continue to bring in revenue, thanks to their popularity on streaming platforms and through various merchandise sales. These films’ lasting appeal ensures that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli remain financially prosperous long after the initial box office run.While all his other retirement announcements, Miyazaki's return to the world of animation has been welcome with every step. In 2013, after announcing his retirement with the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki returned to embark on a new venture, How Do You Live?, to show that the power of his imagination and passion are never spent.","Miyazaki’s films, especially those created under the Studio Ghibli banner, have garnered international acclaim and earned hundreds of millions in revenue.

When ChatGPT turned everything into Studio Ghibli art

Ghibli-style AI art 'melting' GPUs saga continues. Just days ago, the excitement surrounding ChatGPT’s enhanced and user-friendly image generation features prompted OpenAI to impose a temporary cap on requests. In a Twitter update, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote just a say after GPT-4o was rolled out, ""It’s awesome to see people enjoying images in ChatGPT, but our GPUs are overheating. We’re rolling out some temporary rate limits while we optimize things—shouldn’t take too long! Soon, the free tier of ChatGPT will get 3 generations daily."" While Altman didn’t detail the specifics of the limit, he expressed hope that it would be a short-term measure as OpenAI works to manage the demand deluge more efficiently.Days later, the GPU ""meltdown"" narrative continues with a fresh update. This time from Rohan Sahai , product lead for Sora—OpenAI’s video generation tool built by the ChatGPT team. OpenAI Sora, which crafts videos from text, images, and video inputs, too seems to be feeling the 'heat'. Sahai tweeted, ""The demand for 4o image generation has been unreal. It’s been a blast watching the Sora feed overflow with amazing creations. Sadly, our GPUs are frying in Sora territory too, so expect longer wait times or capacity hiccups in the days ahead. We’re hustling to get things back on track.""Sahai quoted CEO Altman’s earlier post about Ghibli-style AI art straining OpenAI’s systems. The company is reportedly tapping its GPT-4o model to power this upgraded image generation tool, yielding visuals that are strikingly lifelike—though users can steer them in countless creative directions. The model has also tackled previous challenges, like rendering text, with notable success.The Ghibli AI art phenomenon kicked off earlier this week when ChatGPT began transforming everything into Studio Ghibli-inspired art. OpenAI’s “Images for ChatGPT” feature nails depth, shadows, and even text with eerie precision, sparking a wave of users mimicking Hayao Miyazaki’s iconic Studio Ghibli style. Already a widespread favorite online for its soothing, gentle vibe (think Lofi Girl), this aesthetic has now become an effortless, automated trend.Predictably, the craze quickly spiraled into wild territory. Internet users have reimagined everything from the Twin Towers on 9/11 and JFK’s assassination to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signing a woman’s chest, Sam Altman’s congressional testimony, and even the Babri Masjid demolition -- all infused with Ghibli’s signature charm. Altman has leaned into the hype, swapping his Twitter profile picture for a Ghibli-fied version of himself and inviting followers to craft him a new one.Interestingly, the rules for Images with ChatGPT allow this kind of experimentation. Per the GPT-4o system card, “The model can mimic the look of certain artists’ styles when their names are included in prompts.” It includes a safeguard: Requests to replicate the style of living artists are blocked. However, as 'The Verge' points out that it is worth noting that Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli is still alive.","Ghibli-style AI art craze is straining OpenAI's systems.
