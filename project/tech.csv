‚Äúthe Pacers may be forced to shop Turner at the deadline if they don't feel like they can afford to re-sign him this summer.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrading him now would help to solidify the roster around Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, and others.‚Äù

Thehave struggled to solidify their center position for years, despite the undeniable talent of Anthony Davis . While Davis has frequently voiced his preference to play power forward, the Lakers have often paired him with centers that haven't quite matched up to expectations. Despite having decent options like JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard, the Lakers found success, including an NBA championship, with those players. However, as the team looks toward the future, the question arises: Will GM Rob Pelinka find a quality center before the trade deadline ?Recent reports suggest that Rob Pelinka is actively exploring options to bring in a reliable center. Names like Jonas Valanciunas of the Washington Wizards , Robert Williams III of the Portland Trail Blazers, and Nikola Vucevic of the Chicago Bulls have been linked to the Lakers. These names represent experienced centers that could complement Davis on the floor. On the cheaper side, players like Day'Ron Sharpe from the Brooklyn Nets and Paul Reed of the Detroit Pistons have also been mentioned as potential targets.However, a more intriguing option has emerged in recent discussions. According to Bleacher Report's Greg Swartz, the Los Angeles Lakers might have their eyes set on Myles Turner, a two-time NBA blocks leader and former No. 11 overall pick. Turner, currently with the Indiana Pacers, could be the perfect addition to fill the Lakers' long-standing need at center.To acquire Myles Turner, Swartz proposed a potential trade package consisting of Rui Hachimura, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, and a 2029 first-round pick (top-5 protected). This package could be enough to entice the Indiana Pacers into making a deal. Swartz pointed out thatMyles Turner could be a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers, offering both scoring and elite shot-blocking ability. As Swartz noted,The Pacers, facing a potential contract dilemma with Turner, might see a trade as a way to position themselves for the future.Myles Turner‚Äôs addition to the Lakers would bring much-needed depth and versatility to their frontcourt. Hachimura, who is averaging 11.9 points and shooting 41.4 percent from three this season, could provide scoring and shooting for the Pacers. Meanwhile, Hayes would give Indiana more size in the post, and Reddish still holds potential at 25 years old.Also read: Warriors Trade Rumor: Stephen Curry and Co. eye $251,000,000 Suns guard to boost championship contention Swartz‚Äôs trade proposal would not only benefit the Lakers but could also help the Pacers as they look to make the most of their current roster. With a future first-round pick included in the deal, Indiana could further build for long-term success, especially after acquiring multiple first-round picks in last year's trade for Pascal Siakam.","The Los Angeles Lakers have struggled to solidify their center position for years.

LaVine‚Äôs scoring ability is seen as a perfect fit alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis to strengthen the team's playoff hopes.

Los Angeles Lakers

‚ÄúIf a Zach LaVine trade does go down, expect Rui Hachimura to headline the package that the Bulls want and receive,‚Äù

‚ÄúHis latent potential could become fully realized in the Windy City. Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jalen Hood-Schifino, and Jaxson Hayes would also have to be moved as well for salary purposes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThough their depth takes a hit, they‚Äôre left with a sound forward rotation (James, Finney-Smith, Christie, Knecht), backcourt rotation (Reaves, LaVine, Reddish, Milton), and center rotation (Davis, Wood),‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an exact science but they should certainly be better at the offensive end.‚Äù

Theare reportedly in talks to acquire Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine in a blockbuster trade as they seek to solidify their roster for the 2024-25 season . Despite a slow start, the Lakers currently hold the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference after 36 games and view LaVine as the key to elevating their playoff aspirations.The proposed deal, according to reports, would include Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jalen Hood-Schifino, and Jaxson Hayes. While losing depth is a concern, the Los Angeles Lakers are willing to make sacrifices to land the two-time All-Star.wrote Quenton Albertie of Last Word on Sports.Both Hood-Schifino and Hayes are on expiring contracts, offering the Bulls some financial flexibility. However, convincing Chicago to take on Vincent‚Äôs contract, which expires in 2026, and Vanderbilt‚Äôs $12 million annual salary through 2028, might require assistance from a third team. A team with cap space or a trade exception could play a pivotal role in finalizing the deal.If the trade materializes, the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô starting lineup would feature LeBron James , Anthony Davis, Austin Reaves, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Zach LaVine. The revamped bench would include Max Christie, Dalton Knecht, Cam Reddish, Shake Milton, and Christian Wood.Albertie added.Zach LaVine‚Äôs scoring prowess, averaging 24.0 points per game with a career-best 45% three-point shooting, would provide a significant offensive boost. His ability to score from all areas of the court, including gravity-defying layups and stop-and-pop jumpers, makes him an ideal fit for Los Angeles.While the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô roster would be thinner post-trade, the front office believes the addition of LaVine outweighs the loss of depth. Zach LaVine‚Äôs balanced skill set is seen as a solution to the team‚Äôs inconsistent guard play, particularly from Vincent, who has struggled to meet expectations.Vincent‚Äôs lackluster performance has opened the door for this move, as Albertie noted,LaVine‚Äôs dynamic scoring ability could be the missing piece for a team aiming to maximize its championship window with LeBron James and Anthony Davis still leading the charge.Also read: LA Lakers Trade Rumor: LeBron James and co. eye $30 million center to bolster roster before February trade deadline Zach LaVine, who is reportedly frustrated with Chicago Bulls ‚Äô losing situation, continues to enhance his trade value with standout performances.

The Broader Implications



Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer‚Äôs marriage was one of the most publicized unions in the literary and artistic worlds. Their creative synergy, open discussions on personal topics, and shared love for pushing boundaries in their respective fields made them a compelling pair. However, their relationship officially ended in November 2022, marking the conclusion of 11 years of marriage. The reasons behind their split, while layered, include issues of personal boundaries, public scrutiny, and allegations that have surfaced in Gaiman‚Äôs personal life.Amanda Palmer, a musician and performance artist, married Neil Gaiman, the celebrated author of works likeand, in 2011. The couple‚Äôs marriage was unconventional from the start. They publicly discussed having an open marriage, a topic that invited both admiration and criticism. Gaiman and Palmer were often candid about the challenges of balancing their creative lives with the demands of marriage and parenthood.However, their relationship began showing cracks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Gaiman‚Äôs decision to travel from New Zealand to the Isle of Skye‚Äîbreaking lockdown protocols‚Äîdrew significant public attention. Palmer, who remained in New Zealand with their son, made cryptic social media posts hinting at tension. While the couple reconciled temporarily after this episode, it was clear that the strain on their relationship was mounting.In late 2022, Palmer and Gaiman announced their divorce. While the announcement was framed as amicable, it left many fans wondering about the deeper reasons behind their separation. The couple emphasized their commitment to co-parenting their son and maintaining a friendship, but the specifics of their breakup were not fully disclosed.Palmer‚Äôs departure from the marriage appeared to be influenced by both personal and external factors. The open nature of their relationship, while celebrated for its honesty, may have also created vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the intense public scrutiny that followed Gaiman‚Äôs actions during the pandemic added a layer of strain.Adding a controversial dimension to the story are the allegations against Neil Gaiman that surfaced in early 2025. Multiple women came forward with accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, bringing renewed attention to Gaiman‚Äôs personal life. These allegations, though unproven, have significantly impacted Gaiman‚Äôs reputation. Some of the accusations involve power imbalances in professional settings, with claims that Gaiman leveraged his influence inappropriately. While he has yet to publicly address these allegations comprehensively, they cast a shadow over his career and personal relationships.Gaiman and Palmer‚Äôs relationship was uniquely positioned at the intersection of art, literature, and modern media. Their openness about topics like polyamory, mental health, and creative struggles endeared them to fans but also exposed them to intense scrutiny. Social media, in particular, played a significant role in amplifying both support and criticism.During the pandemic, Palmer‚Äôs social media posts‚Äîincluding a now-deleted blog post about feeling abandoned‚Äîhinted at deeper personal struggles. While the couple‚Äôs public personas suggested resilience and mutual understanding, it became increasingly clear that their private life was fraught with challenges. The scrutiny likely added pressure to an already strained relationship, making reconciliation difficult.Since the divorce, Palmer has focused on her music and activism. She has spoken about the importance of self-care and boundaries , themes that resonate with her fans. While she has not explicitly commented on the allegations against Gaiman, her post-divorce interviews suggest a desire to distance herself from negativity and focus on personal growth.In one interview, Palmer emphasized the difficulty of navigating public and private life as a couple in the spotlight. ‚ÄúWhen you share your life so openly, it‚Äôs easy for people to assume they know the full story,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut relationships are complex, and sometimes, stepping away is the healthiest choice.‚ÄùThe end of Gaiman and Palmer‚Äôs marriage highlights broader conversations about the complexities of modern relationships. From the challenges of maintaining an open marriage to the impact of public scrutiny, their story reflects the difficulties many couples face‚Äîalbeit on a much larger stage.The allegations against Gaiman add another layer to this narrative, raising questions about accountability, consent, and the power dynamics often present in creative industries. As these allegations continue to unfold, they may influence how Gaiman‚Äôs work is perceived and how future collaborations are approached.","Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer‚Äôs marriage ended in November 2022.

RedNote: US TikTok users flock to Chinese app 'Red Note' to show they don't fear Beijing ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-tiktok-users-flock-to-chinese-app-red-note-to-show-they-dont-fear-beijing-ties/articleshow/117249111.cms,"Manimatana Lee spent the past five years building one of the hottest commodities on the internet: a group of people who reliably watch her videos on TikTok. She built an audience of nearly 10,000 followers with videos of herself vacuuming her house in Wisconsin while her youngest daughter napped in a carrier on her back. A video of Lee dancing and doing the dishes - while wearing her sleeping baby - has been watched more than 1 million times since Nov.Now, with Supreme Court soon to rule in a case that could determine whether TikTok could be banned in the US over security concerns, Lee and other Americans looking for alternatives are downloading Xiaohongshu , a social media app that is popular in China and little known outside the country. ""How funny would it be if they ban TikTok and we all just move over to this Chinese app,"" Lee wrote Monday on TikTok encouraging her followers to join her.Xiaohongshu was the most downloaded free app in the US Apple store on Tuesday. Over 300 million people, mostly in China, use the app, where they share short videos as well as still, text-based posts. People flocking to it said, in interviews and on the app, that they wanted to show they do not share Washington's concerns about TikTok's ties to China.TikTok, which is available in more than 150 countries but not China, is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. American creators who post videos on TikTok say the app has been a source of connection, entertainment and information since it became a sensation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its secret sauce is its proprietary algorithm, technology that recommends a constant stream of short videos targeted to keep people scrolling.But lawmakers in the US and other countries have warned that the Chinese govt could use TikTok to access data about its users. Officials in Washington say they are also concerned that China could use TikTok to spread false information among the 170 million American users.Xiaohongshu means ""little red book"" in Mandarin. Americans new to the app said they were not put off by the reference to a book of Mao Zedong's sayings. Many call the app ""Red Note."" ""I don't really care if I'm using a Chinese app at all,"" said Lee. ""If it's making me feel good, I'm here for it."" A group of American creators have sued the govt over the law that could see the TikTok app forcibly sold or banned in the US, and TikTok is paying their legal fees. Lee and another creator said in interviews that interest in Xiaohongshu hadn't been incentivised by either firm. TikTok and Xiaohongshu didn't comment.Americans on Xiaohongshu have rallied under the hashtag ""TikTokrefugee"", which had been viewed 100 million times and sparked around 2.5 million discussion threads on the app by Tuesday. Joining the app has put American users in closer contact with people online in China than they have ever been on TikTok. Many shared tips on how to navigate the app, which is mainly made for and used by people who read and speak Mandarin. Some took screenshots and asked ChatGPT to translate posts, they said.","Xiaohongshu was the most downloaded free app in the US Apple store on Tuesday.

"Paris, we are coming today: Twitter erupts over post by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-airlines-twitter-pia-paris-9-11/articleshow/117118737.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines' Greatest Hits



Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We‚Äôre Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA‚Äôs marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there‚Äôs Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)‚Äîan entity so hilariously unpredictable that it‚Äôs essentially become the aviation world‚Äôs sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for ‚Äúdivine intervention,‚Äù PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline‚Äôs X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: ‚ÄúParis, we are coming today.‚Äù The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, ‚ÄúFirst, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they‚Äôre going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!‚Äù Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, ‚ÄúPIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‚ÄòFinal Destination.‚Äô‚Äù Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, ‚ÄúThis marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.‚ÄùThe tweet also reignited memories of PIA‚Äôs greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, ‚ÄúFirst it was goats, now it‚Äôs global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.‚Äù @cruindggn added, ‚ÄúAt this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‚ÄòOops Air‚Äô and own it.‚Äù User @saikirankannan chimed in with, ‚ÄúNext stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre just helping it lean a little more.‚Äô‚ÄùOthers couldn‚Äôt help but connect the mishap to Pakistan‚Äôs controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country‚Äôs global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA‚Äôs PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet‚Äôs imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media‚Äôs treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered‚Äîor neglected.One of Goodwin‚Äôs main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC‚Äôs coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media‚Äôs reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK‚Äôs media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk‚Äôs influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What‚Äôs being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it‚Äôs time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, ‚ÄúFind the truth and tell us the truth. That‚Äôs your job.‚Äù","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.‚Äù Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.‚Äù""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

Charles Dickens, while revered for his moralistic tales, was criticised for his treatment of his wife, whom he publicly humiliated before pursuing a younger mistress.These examples expose the enduring tension between artistic genius and personal morality, a question now squarely faced by Neil Gaiman. Renowned for his groundbreaking work in literature and graphic novels, Gaiman finds himself at the centre of sexual assault allegations that threaten to redefine his legacy.Neil Gaiman, a literary icon so revered that he made a guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory, has long been celebrated for his imaginative storytelling. His children‚Äôs book The Wolves in the Walls tells the tale of Lucy, a young girl who hears strange noises behind the walls of her home. Despite her warnings, her family dismisses her concerns as mere imagination. When the wolves finally emerge, they take over the house, forcing the family to flee. Lucy, undeterred, leads them back to confront the wolves and reclaim their home.This story of hidden threats and resilience now parallels a more unsettling reality for Gaiman. Long celebrated as a fearless storyteller, he must now grapple with allegations that have deeply impacted his reputation. The wolves, it seems, have stepped out of the walls of his life.This story of hidden threats and resilience now parallels a more unsettling reality for Gaiman. Long celebrated as a fearless storyteller, he must now grapple with allegations that have deeply impacted his reputation. The wolves, it seems, have stepped out of the walls of his life.The accusations against Neil Gaiman are harrowing in their detail. Scarlett Pavlovich, a former nanny for Gaiman‚Äôs child, alleged that he coerced her into non-consensual sexual acts, including forcing her to perform oral sex. She described the experience as degrading, stating, ‚ÄúIt was not consent. He made me give him [oral sex], and I felt powerless to refuse.‚ÄùAnother woman, identified only as ‚ÄúK,‚Äù alleged that her two-year relationship with Gaiman, which began when she was 20, involved painful and degrading sexual encounters. She claimed there was no discussion of consent or boundaries, leaving her traumatised.These allegations, combined with others from tenants, fans, and colleagues, paint a troubling picture of abuse of power and disregard for personal agency.Neil Gaiman‚Äôs career has been a testament to the transformative power of storytelling. From the groundbreaking graphic novel series The Sandman to novels like American Gods and Coraline, his works have redefined modern literature. Gaiman‚Äôs influence extends to film and television, with adaptations like Netflix‚Äôs The Sandman and Amazon Prime‚Äôs Good Omens cementing his cultural significance.Yet, these achievements are now viewed through a different lens, with his past actions raising difficult questions about the man behind the stories.The literary world is no stranger to reconciling brilliance with controversy. Alongside Gaiman, names like William S. Burroughs, who fatally shot his wife, and Lord Byron, whose personal scandals were as infamous as his poetry, underscore the recurring difficulty in separating art from the artist.For Neil Gaiman, this reckoning has already led to significant fallout. Projects like Good Omens Season 3 and Disney‚Äôs adaptation of The Graveyard Book have been paused or altered. Netflix‚Äôs decision to continue The Sandman has reportedly come with diminished involvement from Gaiman himself.Neil Gaiman‚Äôs story highlights a broader reckoning within creative industries. His works remain beloved by millions, but the allegations against him have irrevocably altered public perception. For fans, reconciling admiration for his creativity with the gravity of these accusations is an emotionally fraught task. Much like Lucy in The Wolves in the Walls, the literary world must decide whether to confront these unsettling truths or retreat into silence. Gaiman‚Äôs legacy now serves as a stark reminder that no figure, no matter how celebrated, is beyond accountability.","Neil Gaiman has been accused of sexual assault by two women.

During this time, he formed a friendship with comic book writer Alan Moore, who encouraged him to try his hand at writing comics.Gaiman‚Äôs big break came with The Sandman (1989‚Äì1996), a groundbreaking comic series published by DC Comics. The story follows Morpheus, the personification of dreams, and masterfully weaves mythology, fantasy, and horror into a complex narrative.The Sandman was one of the first graphic novels to feature on The New York Times Best Seller list. It received multiple awards, including a World Fantasy Award, and helped elevate graphic novels as a serious literary form.Neil Gaiman is renowned for his novels, which have become modern classics, including:1.

Phos-Chek: Pink fire retardant used to fight California wildfires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-phos-chek-pink-powder-helping-firefighters-battle-la-wildfire/articleshow/117225093.cms,"LA wildfires: New evacuations ordered as Palisades Fire expands

As Los Angeles grapples with devastating wildfires, one striking element in the firefighting efforts is the widespread use of a bright pink fire retardant known as Phos-Chek . This specialised chemical, dropped from aircraft and sprayed on vulnerable areas, has become a critical tool in slowing the advance of flames threatening lives and property.Developed by Perimeter Solutions, Phos-Chek has been at the forefront of wildfire suppression for over six decades. First approved by the USDA Forest Service in 1963, the fire retardant has evolved through continual innovation. The company explains that Phos-Chek is more than just a product; it represents a comprehensive firefighting solution. This includes maintaining airbases, supplying advanced equipment, and ensuring an efficient supply chain to deliver resources wherever they are needed most.The vivid pink colour of Phos-Chek serves a practical purpose. It acts as a visual marker for pilots and firefighters, ensuring accurate application during aerial drops. Over time, the dye fades to neutral earth tones when exposed to sunlight, blending back into the natural landscape.Phos-Chek is composed of water, ammonium phosphate fertiliser, and a thickening agent to enhance its stickiness. These ingredients help it adhere to vegetation, creating a fire-resistant barrier. The fertiliser element also aids in the regeneration of scorched land post-fire.As of Monday, firefighters have been working tirelessly to contain two major fires in the Los Angeles area, which have destroyed over 12,000 structures and claimed at least 24 lives. Additional crews and equipment, including water trucks and aerial resources deploying Phos-Chek, have been mobilised to fortify containment lines ahead of predicted strong winds. LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone warned that winds exceeding 70 mph could significantly hinder their efforts.Residents in high-risk areas have been urged to evacuate as conditions remain unpredictable. Among them, Tabitha Trosen shared her preparedness, keeping her cats‚Äô carriers by the door and reflecting on the irreplaceable memories at risk.","Phos-Chek has been at the forefront of wildfire suppression for over six decades.

He had some pervy short stories if I remember correctly."" Another user responded, ""Once upon a time, such stories were never questioned and instead seen as art. Now? It‚Äôs almost like they were living out in the open through their work. Weinstein, Epstein, Ivor Caplin, and now Neil Gaiman.

She detailed how the encounter escalated into a non-consensual act despite her objections.Another accuser, Kendra Stout , alleged Gaiman engaged in BDSM practices without discussing boundaries or obtaining consent, leaving her ""deeply unsettled.""In response, Gaiman has denied all allegations.

Walmart ‚Äôs new logo refresh, the first in 17 years, is drawing widespread attention online, though perhaps not the kind the retail giant was hoping for.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
