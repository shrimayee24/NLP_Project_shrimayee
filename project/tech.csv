Artistry and craftsmanship at the centre



Music that bridges generations



A feast of flavours



A ‘special edition’ with renewed purpose



A festival that leaves a mark



Manipur is hosting the 12th edition of the Sangai Festival from November 21 to 30, 2025, marking a major cultural moment for the state as it prepares to welcome travellers, artisans and performers to one of India’s most immersive celebrations of heritage and identity.First held in 2010, the Sangai Festival has grown into Manipur’s flagship cultural showcase — a ten-day event described as a “Canvas of Culture”, where the state’s rich tapestry of ethnic communities, crafts and performing arts come alive. Officials and local stakeholders say the upcoming edition carries renewed energy, purpose and anticipation, with communities eager to share stories of resilience and revival.The festival takes its name from the endangered Sangai deer, Manipur’s state animal, and symbolises the deep connection between communities and the land they inhabit. Each edition is envisioned as an immersive experience that blends culture, identity and warmth, offering visitors a chance to step into a “living canvas” of traditions nurtured over generations.The 2025 edition continues this ethos, showcasing classical and folk dances, martial art demonstrations, musical performances, and storytelling sessions that reflect Manipur’s artistic soul.Handwoven textiles, bamboo crafts, pottery and indigenous jewellery remain some of the festival’s biggest attractions. These creations, shaped by local artisans using natural materials, mirror Manipur’s geography, cultural motifs and the close bond between the people and their environment.Visitors often enjoy intimate conversations with artisans who recount the personal histories embedded in their creations. This exchange, organisers say, is a defining feature of the festival and helps deepen connections between visitors and Manipuri culture.Music continues to be one of the festival’s emotional anchors. Traditional instruments blend seamlessly with contemporary rhythms as young musicians reinterpret age-old forms. This fusion — increasingly popular among younger audiences — reflects a cultural continuity where heritage evolves in step with changing times.Manipuri cuisine is another highlight of the Sangai Festival. Dishes prepared with fresh, local ingredients introduce visitors to the state’s culinary identity, known for its distinct flavours, herbal richness and wholesome preparations. Food stalls often become informal spaces of cultural exchange, where conversations spark connections among visitors and locals.Festival organisers describe the 12th edition as a “special edition” — one marked by renewal and resilience. After a period of challenges and uncertainty, communities are coming together with a revived sense of purpose, eager to showcase both traditional legacies and emerging contemporary talent.Artisans, dancers, musicians and storytellers are preparing to present their work with greater vibrancy, seeing the 2025 edition as a moment for the world to rediscover Manipur’s cultural harmony.Over the years, the Manipur Sangai Festival has earned a reputation for its authenticity, emotional warmth and immersive experiences, often leaving visitors with lasting memories and a deeper appreciation for the state’s cultural heritage.As preparations begin for the November 2025 edition, officials expect strong turnout and renewed national interest. For many travellers, the festival has become more than an event — it is an invitation to witness Manipur’s creative spirit, shared history and the unique bond between culture and community.With ten days of performances, crafts, cuisine and heartfelt storytelling, the Sangai Festival continues to stand out as one of India’s most soulful cultural gatherings, promising to touch hearts and inspire journeys yet again.","Manipur is hosting the 12th edition of the Sangai Festival from November 21 to 30, 2025.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.” Nvidia also replied to Google stock rally, priasing Google's growth.","Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

‘We’re testing India’s 1st fully digital census in Telangana’: Director Bharati Hollikeri explains houselisting and self-enumeration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/were-testing-indias-1st-fully-digital-census-in-telangana-director-bharati-hollikeri-explains-houselisting-and-self-enumeration/articleshow/125628803.cms,"Census director for Telangana Bharati Hollikeri

In an interview to Sribala Vadlapatla , Census director for Telangana Bharati Hollikeri explains how the digital shift works in the 2027 Census, which will be India’s first fully digital count

What is pretesting, and where is it happening in Telangana?

How exactly are households listed?

What is self-enumeration, and how does it work?

What should people keep in mind?

■ The Census is conducted in two major phases. The first is houselisting, scheduled anytime between Apr and Sept 2026, during which every building, census house and household will be identified, geo-tagged, and systematically listed. The second phase is population enumeration, to be carried out from Feb to Mar 2027, in which demographic details of individuals are recorded. We are currently conducting pretesting for the houselisting operations.It began on Nov 1 and will conclude by the end of the month. Telangana has selected diverse areas to test the digital workflow—one GHMC ward in Ramchandrapuram, seven villages in Pinapaka mandal of Bhadradri Kothagudem, and Thipparthi mandal in Nalgonda district. Pretesting for the population phase will be conducted next year at a time notified by the state govt.■ The Census follows a precise hierarchy: Buildings census houses households. A building may contain multiple census houses, and if a census house has a separate kitchen, it is counted as a different household. Training for field staff was conducted in multiple rounds to make enumerators familiar with the digital tools.To ensure no household is overlooked, we are implementing geo-tagging.After the enumerator completes houselisting, citizens will also have the option to upload selfies of their homes for additional verification.Since this is the first digital houselisting exercise, the pretest includes capturing all details through mobile applications rather than paper schedules. Week one covered self-enumeration; week two completed geo-tagging; and currently, fullscale houselisting with digital tools is underway.■ Nearly 187 household blocks have been identified for the pretest, but over 75,000 households will be covered in the actual exercise. The houselisting operations questionnaire has 35 structured questions, embedded into mobile applications.They capture information such as housing type, construction material, water supply, sanitation, and—new for 2027—mobile numbers. When our trained enumerators, who are govt teachers, visit the households, any family member can key in details directly into the app. Once entered, the system generates a unique code for that house.Enumerators later pull up the data using this code, verify each field with the family, record modifications if needed, and then lock the data.Self-enumeration essentially speeds up the process by allowing citizens to enter details on their own. Those who prefer not to use the app can simply provide information verbally to the enumerator.■ Accuracy and cooperation are key. People must provide correct information and recognise that Census work is different from beneficiary surveys or welfare-linked data collection.Caste details will not be asked during houselisting; they will be recorded only during population enumeration. All individual data is confidential. It will not be shared with any agency—not even through RTI applications.","Census director for Telangana Bharati Hollikeri explains how the digital shift works.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

‘Free countries allow homophobia’: Tucker Carlson challenges Piers Morgan on UK free speech; dares him to use gay slur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/free-countries-allow-homophobia-tucker-carlson-challenges-piers-morgan-on-uk-free-speech-dares-him-to-use-gay-slur/articleshow/125627473.cms,"Tucker Carlson, Piers Morgan (File photos)

Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes & Trump: Inside the Chain Reaction Splitting Republicans Wide Open





Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.During Wednesday’s episode of The Tucker Carlson Show, the topic arose after Carlson referenced a story from The Daily Mail about Elizabeth Kinney, a 34-year-old woman who was convicted of a hate crime for using the slur against her attacker in text messages. She was fined and sentenced to a 12-month community order.Arguing that “you’re allowed to be homophobic if you want in a free country,” Carlson asked Morgan directly: “Would you say the word on camera?”Morgan, who said he hadn’t heard the story before, replied, “No.”Carlson pressed: “Why? You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” He added provocatively, “Ohhh, because it’s so harmful to people? Is it like gay-bashing? What’s wrong with that?”Morgan said you don’t need to use derogatory language about the LGBTQ community to make a point about women’s rights.Carlson used the word several times saying, “I’m using it because you’re not allowed to because you’re …”“I am allowed to, I just choose not to,” Morgan replied.Carlson defended himself, saying he is not anti-gay and “never has been,” adding: “I can use any word I want. How about this? Let my life, the way that I actually live and treat people, be the testament to my heart. That’s how I feel. And if I’ve mistreated someone, that is a sin.”Morgan interrupted, suggesting Carlson wouldn’t use the word directly to a gay person’s face. Carlson responded: “Not in a mean way. Just like the only people who say the ‘N-word’ are Black. Period.”He added that during his time in TV news, he had been around many gay people who used the word themselves.Carlson, who was fired from Fox News in April 2023, has a history of controversial remarks and conspiracy theories.He previously claimed in his biography, Tucker, by Chadwick Moore, that “being racist is not a crime,” though he acknowledged it might be a moral crime.","Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson challenged Piers Morgan to say a gay slur on camera while discussing free speech in the United Kingdom.

Dubai’s VIP dining showdown

The Ultra-Elite Table: At high-end spots like Günaydin in Souk Al Bahar, the most exclusive premium tables (think two tables total) can hit a staggering Dh12,000 per person. This typically includes a set menu and premium beverages.

Premium Dining: Other high-view venues like The Meat Co charge a minimum spend of Dh5,000 for a lower terrace seat.

Why long-standing YouTube creators say the sudden disappearances point to a bigger problem

“bad actors”

“spam-like behavior”





A growing number of YouTubers are reporting a disturbing trend: long-running, well-established channels vanishing from the platform overnight with no clear explanation. These aren’t small accounts or new creators, they’re channels with years of uploads, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, and spotless community guidelines records. Yet many of them are waking up to find their channels suddenly terminated or hit with severe strikes, all under vague labels likeorWhat’s alarming creators even more is that these penalties appear to be triggered by automated, AI-driven moderation systems, not human review.This wave of sudden takedowns has sparked widespread concern across the creator community. Channels like Enderman and several in the tech and gaming categories were abruptly removed, only to be restored later after massive public outcry, suggesting that the original terminations were mistakes. As creators compare notes, a pattern is emerging, automated systems are falsely flagging legitimate channels as harmful, and the appeals process itself is often handled by more automation. With so many livelihoods tied to YouTube, creators are calling these AI errors catastrophic, and some are now urging U.S.creators to involve lawmakers to push for regulatory oversight.At the heart of the issue is YouTube’s increasing reliance on AI moderation to detect policy violations, handle large-scale flagging, and even review appeals. While automation helps the platform manage billions of videos, creators argue that it has become overly aggressive and dangerously inaccurate. The AI is reportedly linking channels toor detectingwithout context, sweeping up innocent creators in the process. Tools like vidIQ and several high-profile YouTubers believe these false positives are becoming more frequent and more damaging.Compounding the frustration is the lack of timely human intervention. Many terminated channels only return after the community rallies behind them, highlighting how dependent creators are on visibility and public pressure rather than reliable internal review systems. As a result, industry voices are warning that the current AI-driven moderation framework is not just flawed, it’s destabilizing the platform and putting creator livelihoods at risk.The sudden disappearance of long-time YouTube channels is more than a glitch, it’s a symptom of a broader moderation crisis fueled by overly assertive AI systems and inadequate human oversight. As creators push for transparency, accountability, and political involvement, the debate over YouTube’s future moderation strategy is only intensifying. For now, one thing is clear: trust in the platform’s safety systems is quickly eroding.Also Read: Who is Clavicular?

Legal Mindset outlines the high cost of litigation and why the streamers may need a strategic settlement to survive the case

Ethan Klein DENIES Kaceytron Settlement (Fast Facts)





YouTuber Andrew Legal Mindset recently assessed the ongoing legal battle involving Ethan Klein and streamers Denims, Frogan, and Kaceytron on his channel. The lawyer went deep into the Klein’s lawsuit against the three and the devastating effect that it has brought both emotionally and financially. In his latest video titled Ethan Klein DENIES Kaceytron Settlement (Fast Facts), Andrew laid out the facts of the matter and how the four were tied to the infringement case issued by Klein.With the case’s ongoing momentum, Legal Mindset is shifting the focus of the conversation from accusations to whether the three accused can even support themselves monetarily in the case. With Klein even rejecting a settlement offer from Kaceytron, and no further signs of other remedial actions, Legal Mindset suggests that the three should start being truthful and transparent about the whole matter.During his breakdown of the whole lawsuit situation, Legal Mindset explained that litigation of this scale can average around $384,000 if it goes to trial. Further, he pointed out that if the three of them go through discovery, which comes with its own share of inconveniences, including paperwork and attorney hours, it may come in the range of $50,000 on its own.He also outlined the financial situations of the three accused, saying that “Denims and Frogan may go broke before finishing discovery,” and “Kaceytron barely has enough to make it to trial.”For Legal Mindset, the best thing they can do is to come up with a creative settlement with Klein with full transparency about what happened that led to the infringement lawsuit.This includes not just monetary settlements but also giving up names and vital information. Additionally, he suggested strategies such as public apologies, “publicly retracting their statements”, and voluntarily turning over Discord and Reddit messages to convince Klein to accept a settlement.He also called Kaceytron’s previous $17,500 settlement offer as chump change, which is far below what Klein may have already spent on attorneys so far. For now, none of the three streamers have issued responses to Andrew’s assessments.Also read: HasanAbi blasts Legal Mindset amid toy gun controversy, calls him a “‘f**king psychotic MAGA lawyer” live on stream","YouTuber Andrew Legal Mindset assessed the ongoing legal battle involving Ethan Klein and streamers Denims, Frogan, and Kaceytron on his channel.

What is “Ahlīyatuk”?

Funded by Zakat: Uniquely, the program’s funding comes primarily from Zakat, the mandatory Islamic charity, ensuring that the support is distributed to those determined to be truly deserving.

A Safety Net with a Ladder: Unlike old welfare systems, this new structure focuses on rehabilitation, training, and employment. The system categorizes beneficiaries and implements empowerment plans to help those able to work transition from reliance on aid to becoming productive contributors to the economy.

Key Timeline: The modern, enhanced program was introduced in 2022, marking a significant upgrade from the previous system.

What to do if your eligibility hasn’t appeared?

Not visible yet? If the eligibility option is missing, your application likely hasn’t been finalised. Wait until the eligibility-review window (completed by the 9th) closes.

Check carefully: Re-enter credentials and ensure you selected the correct programme page (الضمان الاجتماعي).

Still stuck: Contact HRSD through the official portal, the ministry’s support channels, or their verified social accounts for help. News outlets repeatedly advise avoiding rumours and relying only on the ministry’s official site for status and payment confirmation.





The Developed Social Security System (الضمان الاجتماعي المطور), known locally as ""Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar,"" is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net. Overseen by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD), this comprehensive program goes beyond simple aid by focusing on both immediate financial support and long-term empowerment.It aims to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 by ensuring that cash support reaches the most vulnerable while simultaneously transitioning recipients toward financial independence.“Ahlīyatuk” refers to the eligibility result for the developed Social Security (الضمان الاجتماعي المطوّر) program administered by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD). The eligibility check tells applicants whether their support request was approved for the current cycle or if further documentation is needed. This is the single monthly status beneficiaries watch to know if they will receive that month’s cash disbursement. The primary goal of the Developed Social Security program is to alleviate poverty and guarantee that eligible families and individuals secure a minimum monthly income for basic needs.Follow these exact steps to see your eligibility quickly:If the eligibility page or button does not appear, it usually means your application has not yet been processed, the Ministry says eligibility reviews are completed before the 9th of each Gregorian month.Applicants should wait until that window closes before checking again.HRSD has a fixed disbursement routine: approved beneficiaries generally receive their social security payment on the 1st day of each Gregorian month. For example, the news guidance confirms the December 2025 payment is scheduled for 1 December 2025; rumors of early payouts are false, the Ministry has said. Use the HRSD payments page to confirm the deposit date and transaction details.A clear, fast eligibility check reduces anxiety for applicants and cuts the spread of false claims about early payments or changed dates. Using the official HRSD platform and following the exact steps above ensures beneficiaries know their status accurately and can take corrective action if additional documentation is required.","The Developed Social Security System (Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar) is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net.

NutriCheck & NIC Role: To ensure accountability, DM introduced the NutriCheck self-auditing platform. This mandates monthly self-audits by catering companies and schools. Furthermore, a new role, the Nutrition in Charge (NIC), must be appointed in each institution. The NIC is a trained staff member responsible for overseeing daily nutritional quality and compliance, similar to the existing Person in Charge (PIC) for general food safety.

The new menu rules

Food Category Color Code Status Examples Encouraged Daily Green Promote access and consumption Fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, water, low-fat milk. Allowed Occasionally Yellow Consume in controlled portions Foods that can be included with moderation and portion control. Restricted Red Limited/Rare consumption only Foods that are high in specific fats or sugars. Banned Entirely Black Strictly prohibited from canteens Deep-fried foods, heavily processed snacks, high-sugar beverages.

Portion Control: Meals must feature age-specific planning and mandatory calorie calculations.



Clarity in Labeling: Labels must be clearer, detailing nutritional information based on the actual serving size (the amount a student consumes), not just per 100 grams.



Core Requirements: Emphasis is placed on boosting nutrient-dense foods and fibre intake, while regulating or reducing added sugar and caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee).



Holistic Safety: Protocols also cover institutional hygiene standards and strict allergy management.

The 2025-2026 academic rollout





Dubai is leveling up student wellness with a massive, tech-driven initiative aimed at revolutionizing school meals and fighting childhood health issues. Spearheaded by Dubai Municipality (DM), the new ""My School Food"" digital platform is much more than a website; it is an entire ecosystem designed to ensure every child across the emirate eats healthier, safer food.This landmark initiative, unveiled during the 19th Dubai International Food Safety Conference, is a strategic response to widespread health concerns, including high rates of childhood obesity and lifestyle disorders. The goal is clear: to foster sustainable, healthy eating habits from a young age and support children’s physical and cognitive development.The program’s scale is ambitious. It targets more than 400,000 students across over 500 educational institutions, including schools, nurseries, and universities. Critically, it also brings more than 50 school food suppliers and caterers under a single, rigorous regulatory umbrella. By transforming the food environment in educational facilities, Dubai aims to create a new, long-term standard for student health.Dubai Municipality has launched a digital platform called My School Food to raise the standard of meals served in schools and teach students healthy eating habits.The platform bundles menu approval tools, nutrition guidance, e-learning for pupils, and dashboards for schools, parents and suppliers so every stakeholder can track meals and compliance.The most visible change for students and parents is the introduction of stricter, evidence-based nutritional guidelines enforced via the Smart Food Choices System. This system categorizes foods using a clear, color-coded structure to nudge everyone toward healthier decisions:The detailed guidelines go beyond color-coding, demanding that schools and suppliers adhere to strict rules on:Dubai's 'My School Food' platform marks a monumental shift towards prioritizing student health through technology and strict standards.

Dubai Police Search & Rescue teams carried out 5,200 missions in the first 10 months of 2025 and cut average land-incident response time to 5.8 minutes, beating the strategic target of 6.6 minutes and marking a steady improvement from 6.8 minutes in 2023 and 6.2 minutes in 2024.Dubai Police have achieved unprecedented success in emergency response, setting new benchmarks for global safety forces. Recent figures confirm a dramatic improvement in speed, ensuring patrols and rescue teams reach critical incidents faster than ever before.For critical emergencies, the average response time recorded in the third quarter of this year was an impressive two minutes and seven seconds (2:07). This achievement highlights a continuous improvement compared to the previous year, securing Dubai's reputation for exceptional rapid response.Officials say the gains come from a combination of upgraded readiness, smarter resource allocation and new equipment. During an inspection, Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, reviewed smart support systems that help dispatch the right units quickly, dedicated vehicle fleets for field and specialised tasks, and closer coordination with the Air Wing.The specialized Search and Rescue teams have also significantly cut their time on the ground. Response times for land-based incidents now average just 5.8 minutes, successfully beating the annual operational target of 6.6 minutes. This represents an improvement of over 14% in readiness across just three years, demonstrating operational excellence is the force's top priority.This remarkable speed is directly powered by smart technology embedded within the General Department of Operations. The Command and Control Centre is the nerve center, demonstrating efficiency even before the teams are dispatched.Key Call Centre Statistics:The use of autonomous technology is also revolutionizing field response. The innovative Drone Box system has become a game-changer, facilitating approximately 3,000 transfers last year. In scenarios classified as ""very urgent,"" the drones achieved an astonishing average response time of just 57 seconds, far surpassing the target of 2 minutes and 45 seconds.This pioneering drone system has garnered international recognition, including the prestigious Edison Award for Autonomous Security Solutions.

Abu Dhabi new peak-hour ban

Day Restriction Period 1 (Morning Peak) Restriction Period 2 (Evening Peak/Midday) Monday to Thursday 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM Friday 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM (Midday/Jumaa Prayer)

Abu Dhabi Island



Major city arteries and urban zones



Key entry points like Al Maqta Bridge and Mussafah Bridge



The December 1 rule

Purpose: To accommodate smooth traffic flow and major public events during extended national holidays.



Vehicles Restricted: Typically includes trucks, lorries, and large buses used for transporting workers (50 or more passengers).



Duration Example: A typical holiday ban might run from Friday (mid-day) through Monday (early morning). For instance, restrictions have been implemented from 12:00 PM on Friday, December 1, until 1:00 AM on Monday, December 4.



Locations Affected: Entrances to Abu Dhabi Island, including Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Mussafah Bridge, and Al Maqta Bridge.



Enforcement and compliance

Mandatory Permits: Companies must obtain a freight transport permit from the ITC to operate legally in the Emirate.



Digital Tracking: Vehicles must install electronic tracking devices linked to the ""Asateel"" system. This enables authorities to monitor vehicle location in real-time and ensure compliance with designated routes and restricted hours.



Validity: Operator permits are valid for one year, and driver permits are valid for two years, requiring timely renewal.







The Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) in Abu Dhabi has rolled out essential restrictions on heavy vehicle movement, fundamentally changing logistics planning in the emirate. This move is a strategic step to curb traffic congestion, enhance public safety, and protect vital road infrastructure. These regulations apply across major city roads and entry points, requiring all transport operators to strictly adhere to the revised schedules.To manage the significant volume of daily traffic, the ITC, under Abu Dhabi Mobility, enforces clear ""no-entry"" times for heavy vehicles. The updated rules primarily target freight trucks, large tankers, and construction equipment, aiming to separate slower-moving, heavier traffic from light vehicles during the busiest commuting periods. This separation is crucial, as the interaction between vehicle types often leads to speed variation and accidents.Crucial Locations Affected:This timing is carefully calculated to reduce delays for commuters, allowing emergency and public transport vehicles to move efficiently during rush hours.The original restriction linked to the beginning of December often refers to a temporary, extended ban implemented during national holidays or long weekends, such as the UAE Union Day celebrations.Key Details of Temporary Bans:Exemptions: In both permanent and temporary scenarios, crucial vehicles are usually excluded from the ban, specifically those needed for public sanitation services and vehicles carrying logistical support or essential utilities.Adherence to these rules is mandatory and monitored by the Abu Dhabi Police using advanced systems. Violations are tracked digitally, and non-compliance results in significant penalties, including fines and potential vehicle impoundment for repeat offenders.To streamline and monitor commercial movement, the ITC introduced the ""Asateel"" platform.What Logistics Operators Need to Know:The integration of smart systems ensures that these traffic regulations are not just policies on paper but are actively enforced in the digital and physical traffic landscape of the capital. The ITC and Abu Dhabi traffic authorities will enforce the restrictions; drivers found in breach may face regulatory action under traffic law. The ITC has released maps and alternative-route guidance to help compliance.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

AR Rahman reveals the first thing he told Sam Altman and Aravind Srinivas: Don't make people …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ar-rahman-reveals-the-first-thing-he-told-sam-altman-and-aravind-srinivas-dont-make-people-/articleshow/125615921.cms,"“broken record,”

“Don't make people lose jobs.”

“empower people”

“generational curses”

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Read AR Rahman’s message to AI leaders





“My first comment with any AI person is, don't make people lose jobs. Empower people to remove the curses of generational curses, which come to poverty, misinformation, and lack of tools to create stuff, to telling stories, right? From the beginning, I was like a broken record just saying this.

If you buy a gun, you've set rules, right? You don't give it to everyone, because they're gonna shoot everybody. They're going to kill people. It's not free to use. It has restrictions. Now you're not shooting people, but you can pull the carpet off, make them jobless. It's like making families go into poverty. So it is the rules. Humans have to set the rules. You have traffic rules. You have immigration rules.”

“equaliser”

“vision but not resources.”

“son's friend, more than me. Yeah, they hang out.”

What AR Rahman said about his Secret Mountain project with OpenAI





“Secret Mountain”

“We use the best of AI, and we use the best of humans.”

“He [Sam Altman] was looking at the Secret Mountain, and he was fascinated, I think. He [Altman] said, ‘Whatever help you guys need in technology,’ But I think this is not just…Secret Mountain is about fashion, merchandise, music, wisdom, and entertainment. Quite a big package, and pretty exhausting if you don't have a big team. So that's one of the reasons why we are waiting for the big leap, too, which is preparing all the groundwork on that one,”





AR Rahman has shared insights from his personal interactions with two of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence: ChatGPT-maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas. During an appearance on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's People by WTF podcast, the music legend said that he has spent a lot of time with them. He also revealed that he stressed a core message to both AI leaders from the very beginning of their conversations.

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse





A federal judge has condemned the practice of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents using artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, to draft official use-of-force reports. She warned that the practice “undermines the agents’ credibility and may explain the inaccuracy of these reports.” The condemnation has been issued by US District Judge Sara Ellis in a two-sentence footnote tucked within a 223-page opinion last week regarding law enforcement responses to immigration protests in the Chicago area.The judge highlighted specific evidence found in body camera footage, noting that at least one agent was observed asking ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after providing the program with only “a brief sentence of description and several images.”She highlighted factual discrepancies between the official narratives generated by the AI and what the body camera footage actually showed, as per a report in Fortune. Experts warn that the failure to use an officer’s actual experience raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy in high-stakes legal documentation.Experts are calling the incident a severe breach of protocol, especially concerning reports that justify law enforcement actions.“What this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures — if that’s true, if that’s what happened here — that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It’s a nightmare scenario,” Ian Adams, an assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and a member of the Council for Criminal Justice’s AI task force, was quoted as saying.“We need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer... That is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts,” he added.Meanwhile, Katie Kinsey, tech policy counsel at the Policing Project, noted that use of public AI tools also creates critical privacy risks. She highlighted that the agent may have unwittingly violated policy by uploading images to a public version of ChatGPT, potentially making them part of the public domain.",US District Judge Sara Ellis has condemned the practice of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
