Maha Mantra

Sounds Of Isha - Aum Namah Shivaya | Chant | 1 Hour Version

Does Taking a Dip at Mahakumbh Wash Away Sins?

As the holy Mahakumbh draws millions of devotees, Sadhguru , speaking amidst the vibrant energy of Prayagraj , urged Indians not to miss this once-in-a-lifetime event.“There is no place like this on the planet. What is happening here is a phenomena beyond logic. It is a civilizational phenomena. It is something that everybody should see, everybody should experience. It doesn’t matter if you’re religious, not religious, spiritual, not spiritual, you are seeking liberation or you like bondage – it doesn’t matter what! Still, as a civilizational phenomena, it is too fantastic to be in Bharat and to miss it! Don’t do that!”“Just come for half day, experience this whole exuberance. Being born in India you can’t miss an event which happens once in 144 years!” emphasized Sadhguru.Explaining the significance of this year’s Mahakumbh, Sadhguru highlighted its celestial importance and said, “This is definitely more significant because Kumbh is our planet’s relationship with the Sun and particularly Jupiter. This is the time, by January 23 or so, when seven celestial objects will be lined up in the sky for us to see. They all have lined up after 144 years.”“When water bodies meet with a certain force at specific latitudinal positions during certain times of the year, it creates a massive possibility of life. Two-thirds of your body is water. If you are in spaces where water is in a certain dynamic, it impacts the body tremendously. Especially once in every 12-year solar cycle, a moment comes when it has maximum impact. This is the Maha Kumbh,” explained Sadhguru in another video about the profound impact of Mahakumbh.As millions of devotees gear to take a dip, Sadhguru has encouraged devotees to chant the Maha Mantra —“Aum Namah Shivaya”—for 21 minutes each morning and evening, ideally for 21 days before attending the Maha Kumbh. He guides practising this during before the sun rises above a 30-degree angle and in the evening twilight after the sun dips below 30 degrees.“So, you’re going to Kumbh, Maha Kumbh, which has gone on for many millennia. And at least go prepared. Before the sun rises over thirty-degree angle and also in the evening, after the sun goes below thirty degrees, twenty-one minutes in the morning, twenty-one minutes in the evening, just sit in a cross-legged posture, put yourself with great involvement, just do Mahamantra,” he says.Addressing the common belief, Sadhguru explained, “Definitely certain cleansing is happening. One day’s dip is not the thing. Today you are going like a tourist, (but) you must stay there for one mandala– forty-eight days. If you stay there, do the right kind of practices and use the water as a way of enhancing your system, then the water within you– seventy-two percent, or two-thirds of the body which is water– if this water behaves the way you want, suddenly you will be a fantastic human being.”“The entire process of yogic sciences has come from the fundamental or the foundation that we call as Bhuta Shuddhi, that means cleansing these five elements. So what you are calling as Kumbh Mela is also one expression of Bhuta Shuddhi process, which is a foundation of the yogic system.”The Mahakumbh is not just an event—it is a profound cosmic phenomenon that has stood the test of time, celebrated for millennia through a deep Yogic understanding of the interplay between celestial forces and human life. Devotees can maximize its transformative power by approaching it with awareness and devotion.Sadhguru’s guidance, throws an opportunity for every seeker to align with these sacred energies, making their experience at the Mahakumbh not just memorable but personally transformative.","The holy Mahakumbh draws millions of devotees.

Jackson Mahomes Faces Backlash Over TikTok Farewell Amid Chiefs Playoff Push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jackson-mahomes-faces-backlash-over-tiktok-farewell-amid-chiefs-playoff-push/articleshow/117328634.cms,"Patrick Mahomes' brother faces TikTok backlash as NFL legend roasts QB’s family choices (Images via Imagn and Twitter)

“Since the app is getting banned, I thought y’all would miss your favorite creator on the platform!”

“What NFL fans are watching his daily content?”

“The little brother that rides on the fame of his older accomplished 3-time Super Bowl-winning brother. No one cares about Jackson Mahomes and his terrible dance moves.”

Mahomes largely avoided trouble during the 2024 NFL season, but before its start, he faced legal issues. In February 2023, he was accused of grabbing a woman by the neck and forcibly kissing her at a restaurant. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery in March 2024 and received six months of probation.

From dances to controversies, Jackson Mahomes’ TikTok journey has been messy

“I want to sincerely apologize for accidentally being on the Sean Taylor #21 at FedEx Field. We were directed to stand in that area, and I meant absolutely no disrespect to him or his family.”

""Sup I get bullied a lot but I'm still here.

""

""Do I use him for clout? No … I mean … I don't necessarily use him for clout but there are a lot of advantages and I get a lot of opportunities by being his brother, so that's pretty cool,""

As Chiefs face playoff pressure, distractions like this don’t help

Even Ryan Fitzpatrick couldn’t resist trolling the Mahomes family over baby names

“I feel bad for Bronze... They’re running out of precious metals to name their kids!”

Chiefs are two wins away from tying NFL history, but the pressure is real

Jackson Mahomes, brother of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , caused yet another stir with his farewell video on TikTok. The younger Mahomes cited the app’s rumored ban as the reason for his goodbye, saying,The reaction? Brutal. NFL fans didn’t hold back, questioning why this even needed to be an announcement. One fan quipped,Another added fuel to the fire, commenting,While Jackson Mahomes gained over 1.1 million followers on TikTok, his fame has been as controversial as it has been polarizing. In 2021, he faced backlash for dancing on the memorial of Sean Taylor during a Chiefs game. The move was widely condemned, forcing Jackson to apologize:Despite his apologies, Jackson’s antics have frequently landed him in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, making him a polarizing figure among fans of the Chiefs and the NFL at large.Jackson Mahomes boasts over a million TikTok followers, sharing game-day moments, dance trends, and vlogs, often collaborating with brands like Casetify and Amazon Prime. His TikTok bio hints at the criticism he faces:He also has 247,000 Instagram followers, 35,000 X followers, and 25,000 YouTube subscribers. In his debut YouTube video, Jackson acknowledged accusations of leveraging his brother’s fame.he said.While Jackson’s social media antics dominated headlines, Patrick Mahomes has his eyes firmly set on the playoffs. After a 25-day break, the Chiefs are gearing up for a critical divisional-round game against the Houston Texans. A win would move the Chiefs one step closer to a seventh consecutive AFC Championship Game appearance.Some fans see Jackson’s TikTok farewell as oddly timed, with the postseason underway. Others believe his exit could be a good thing, reducing potential distractions for Patrick as the Chiefs push for another Super Bowl run.On a lighter note, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes recently welcomed their third child, a daughter named “Golden.” She joins siblings Sterling Skye and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon.Former NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick couldn’t resist poking fun at the unique names, tweeting:Fitzpatrick didn’t stop there, suggesting names like “Rusty Can,” “Scrap Metal,” and “Participation Trophy” for potential future additions to the Mahomes family.Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are chasing history this postseason. A win against the Texans would edge them closer to tying the New England Patriots’ record of eight consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances from 2011 to 2018.The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. EST at Arrowhead Stadium, with everything on the line. Patrick Mahomes has carried the Chiefs through pressure before, but with distractions like Jackson’s farewell video and the ever-watchful NFL spotlight, this run might feel heavier than usual.It’s clear the Mahomes family knows how to trend, whether it’s on the field or on TikTok.

The Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle has announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, in a post on Tuesday. She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion. She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

Poll What Do You Think About Hindenburg Research Shutting Down? Surprising Decision After Major Revelations A Bold Move After a History of Impactful Reports

Why has Hindenburg Research shut down?

Below is the full text of his personal note:

As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.

I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.

I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.

When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.

It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.

And then this slowly started to flourish.

One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.

They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.

We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.

Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.

And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.

Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.

It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.

I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.

So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.

Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.

Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.

My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.

For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.

It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.

To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.

Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.

With unfathomable levels of gratitude,

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Microsoft to end Microsoft 365 apps support for Windows 10 on this date,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-end-microsoft-365-apps-support-for-windows-10-on-this-date/articleshow/117319046.cms,"Challenges with Windows 11 Adoption

Microsoft extends security updates for Windows 10

Microsoft has announced that its Office apps, now called Microsoft 365 apps, will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025. In a blog post, Microsoft stated, “Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11 .” The date also marks the end of official support for the Windows 10 operating system. To continue using Microsoft 365 apps without issues, users will need to upgrade to Windows 11.Microsoft says that though after the support ends, the Office apps won’t stop working right away. However, users might face performance and reliability problems over time, the company warns.Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 11, calling 2025 “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” Speaking at CES, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, emphasized the importance of upgrading:“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone. It will be their Windows 10 PC, and they will move forward with Windows 11”.Many Windows 10 users haven’t switched to Windows 11 yet, partly because older PCs don’t meet the strict hardware requirements. For instance, Windows 11 demands a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which Microsoft says is “non-negotiable.” Gamers too are reluctant to switch to Windows 11, citing concerns about compatibility and performance.To encourage users to upgrade, Microsoft has started showing full-screen prompts suggesting they buy new PCs.While the support for Windows 10 will end this year, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for the first time. Consumers can pay $30 for an extra year of updates, while businesses can purchase up to three years of extended support.As the October 2025 deadline approaches, Microsoft is making it clear that upgrading to Windows 11 is essential for a seamless experience with its apps and services.","Microsoft 365 apps will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025.

Who is Rhea Ripley’s mother?



Rhea Ripley is one of the top WWE superstars of the modern era. While Mami is renowned in the wrestling world, her parents, especially her mother have remained out of the limelight watching her daughter succeed from the sidelines.Rhea Ripley became a top fixture for WWE in the modern era. The Eradicator honoured her in-ring skills in Australia and made a dominant impact in various promotions such as Professional Wrestling Alliance, Riot City Wrestling, Pro Wrestling ZERO1, REINA, and World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana.After conquering multiple promotions in her home country and overseas, Rhea Ripley made her WWE debut in 2017 as part of the Mae Young Classic. She was groomed into the WWE style with her stints in NXT UK and NXT. This led to her main roster debut on RAW in 2021. However, it was not until she joined Edge’s Judgment Day that her popularity skyrocketed through the roof, and she became a top name in the WWE Women’s division. Mami’s stint as a member of The Judgment Day and being the onscreen girlfriend of Dominik Mysterio made her a mainstream attraction on WWE television programming.Moreover, she had a record-setting WWE Women’s Championship reign and recently regained her WWE Women’s World title from Liv Morgan on the debut episode of RAW on Netflix.Amidst so much success, an important part of Rhea Ripley’s career has been her parents. However, Mami’s parents have chosen to remain out of the spotlight while continuing to be huge pillars in the life of her superstar daughter.Rhea Ripley’s incredible success has come due to the support of her parents. But Ripley has spoken more about her father Peter Bennett being highly supportive of her wrestling career. However, her mother, Anna Bennett is very little known to the fans of professional wrestling.Anna Bennett is Mami’s Mami who is the reason the fans feel the presence of one of the most dominant WWE superstars of the modern era. Anna is a homemaker living with Rhea’s father, Peter in Adelaide, Australia. She has played a crucial role in shaping her daughter’s career in wrestling and raised Ripley with strong values.Along with Rhea, Anna also gave birth to her younger daughter, Calista Bennett.

Will Dominik Mysterio Turn Face?

WWE superstar , Dominik Mysterio has been named as Pro Wrestling Illustrated’s “2024 Most Hated Wrestler of the Year.” While the name may not show it, this is actually the perfect award for Dirty Dom. Mysterio has been the most polarising wrestler on the roster and his romantic storylines have often been the topic of debate among the WWE Universe. Of course, Mysterio being a heel is often one of the most disliked and disrespected wrestlers during these debates. However, his character might be about to undergo massive changes.Continue reading to learn more about the possible character changes that await Dominik Mysterio.Mysterio’s relationship with Rhea Ripley is clearly over following RAW’s debut on Netflix. On the January 6th episode, Ripley defeated Liv Morgan to become the new Women’s World Champion. Following Ripley’s win, Dominik Mysterio went into the ring to embrace Ripley. The Eradicator quickly shot down Dom’s advances by hitting him with a low blow followed by a Riptide.Now, on RAW the following week, Dominik Mysterio apologized to Liv Morgan. But there seems to be a very real crack in Mysterio’s relationships following his actions on the January 6th episode. This could be foreshadowing that Mysterio’s relationship with Morgan is also about to come to an end. If this is the case, Dominik Mysterio would once again be free to do his own thing.While Dirty Dom has thrived as a heel, it would be interesting to see what his character would be like if he turned face. Fans have begun to speculate about the same following RAW’s debut on Netflix. When he’s in the ring, Mysterio does have the ability to get the crowd behind him.
