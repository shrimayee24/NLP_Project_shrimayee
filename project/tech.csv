Why GenAI appeals to kids

New Delhi: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is fast becoming part of children's learning routines in India, but a deep misconception about what the technology actually does is spreading just as quickly. Bharat Survey for EdTech 2025, released by Central Square Foundation on Wednesday, showed 35% of children who already use edtech are using GenAI tools for learning, even as nearly three-fourths of GenAI-aware children wrongly believe these tools are simply internet search engines.The survey, conducted between July 2025 and Jan 2026 covering 12,500 households and 2,500 teachers across 10 states, showed that for children from low-income households, GenAI adoption is no more experimental: 96% use it multiple times a week, and 69% operate it daily.Yet, understanding lags sharply behind usage. While 85% of GenAI-aware children said they understood how it works, 72% equated it with a search application, blurring the line between probabilistic AI-generated responses and verified online information.This gap is critical as 46% of respondents flagged ""wrong information"" as a key risk associated with edtech and GenAI use, alongside concerns about overuse.The report showed that children were primarily using GenAI for school-linked activities, with 73% relying on it for doubt-solving and practice, 48% for learning new skills or language translation, and 32% for test preparation.The main attractions are easy-to-understand explanations (45%), quick responses that save time (41%), and interactive formats (40%) - features that make GenAI especially appealing in homes where adult academic support may be limited.However, experts warned that high-frequency use without foundational AI literacy could amplify risks.The New Delhi-based NGO said the findings highlighted an urgent need to move beyond access and adoption metrics.","35% of children who already use edtech are using GenAI tools for learning.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar Vembu said Sarvam AI's work shows that ‘world-class AI’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Instagram’s beauty filters and free expression



Underage users and enforcement



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18). According to a report by CNBC, Zuckerberg informed that court that he had reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss the ‘well being of teens and kids’. The comments from Meta CEO came after the defense lawyers presented emails between the two executives, aiming to highlight that Zuckerberg was proactive about the safety of kids and teens on Instagram . “I care about the wellbeing of teens and kids who are using our services,” Zuckerberg said.The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users. Lawyers pressed Zuckerberg on internal discussions about banning cosmetic surgery filters after experts warned that these filters will have negative impact of the teenage girls. The report adds that Zuckernger acknowledged the concerns but mentioned that the decision came down to free expression. “I genuinely want to err on the side of giving people the ability to express themselves,” he testified.Along with this, the case also centers on the allegations that Meta designed Instagram to maximise the time spent on the app. However, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying that the engagement metrics were used as internal milestones rather than company goals.The evidence presented in the court included documents from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, showing targets to increase daily user time to 40 minutes in 2023 and 46 minutes in 2026.The lawyers also questioned whether Meta adequately prevents under-13 users from joining Instagram. As the documents presented before the court revealed that nearly 4 million children under the age of 13 are using the platform in the US. Replying to the question, Meta CEO admitted that some users lie about their age but he also said that Meta removes underage accounts when identified and Instagram only began requiring birthdays at sign‑up in late 2019.The trial also saw unusual moments, with Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl warning that anyone using AI smart glasses during testimony would be held in contempt. Members of Zuckerberg’s team were photographed wearing Meta’s Ray‑Ban AI glasses before entering the courthouse.The Los Angeles case is one of several lawsuits this year accusing social media companies of harming young users’ mental health. Meta faces another trial in New Mexico, where the state’s attorney general alleges the company failed to protect children from online predators.",Mark Zuckerberg testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18) The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users.

Why Mark Zuckerberg's Meta new deal with Nvidia is 'bad news' for Intel and AMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerbergs-meta-new-deal-with-nvidia-is-bad-news-for-intel-and-amd/articleshow/128540166.cms,"Why Meta-Nvidia deal is bad news for Intel and AMD



Analysts weigh in



Meta has announced a sweeping ‘multigenerational’ deal with Nvidia. With this deal the Facebook-parent is deepening its reliance on the AI chip giant. According to a report by Business Insider, the agreement will see Meta build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia’s current and next generation chips for both AI trading and inference. The move also underscores Meta’s commitment to Nvidia even as it develops in-house chips and explores alternatives like AMD processors and Google’s TPUs.The Meta-Nvidia deal is important because it goes beyond GPUs. Meta will also deploy Nvidia’s CPUs, a domain traditionally dominated by Intel and AMD. CPUs are the backbone of general computing tasks in data centers, whereas GPUs are designed to handle specialised workloads such as AI training. By sourcing both from Nvidia, Meta reduces the complexity and consolidates its AI stack under a single vendor.Analysts also say that this approach could squeeze Intel and AMD’s market share, especially as Nvidia markets its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. With CPUs playing a larger role in Ai interface where efficient and cost matter and expansion of Nvidia in this space threatens to erode the long-standing dominance of Intel and AMD.Along with the chips, Meta will also use Nvidia’s networking equipment and confidential computing technology to run AI features inside WhatsApp. The companies plan to deploy Nvidia’s next‑generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, further cementing Nvidia’s role in Meta’s ecosystem.* Patrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy: The deal may cool speculation about Meta’s TPU talks with Google, but it highlights Nvidia’s growing role in AI infrastructure.* Rob Enderle, Enderle Group: CPUs are cheaper and more power‑efficient for inference, making Nvidia’s dual offering attractive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Why Mark Zuckerberg's trial matters

In a high-stakes trial unfolding in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm. The case centers on allegations that Meta’s platforms, including Instagram , were designed in ways that deliberately promote addictive use among children and teens, contributing to serious mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The trial, which also includes Google’s YouTube as a co-defendant, is widely regarded as one of the most consequential legal tests confronting Big Tech in recent years. A verdict here could influence thousands of similar lawsuits nationwide.The civil suit was filed by a plaintiff identified as “KGM,” now 20, who alleges that using platforms like Instagram from a young age fostered compulsive behaviour and exacerbated her mental health struggles. Her lawyers argue that Meta’s engagement-driven features, such as algorithmic recommendation systems and infinite scrolling, are engineered to keep young users engaged in ways that mirror addictive design practices used in other industries. Meta, for its part, vigorously denies these claims and maintains that the company has no intention to addict children or to profit from youth vulnerability. In court testimony, Zuckerberg emphasised that Meta does not allow children under 13 on Instagram, though he acknowledged it is “very difficult” to verify ages and enforce this rule perfectly.During his testimony, Zuckerberg faced intense questioning about internal policies, platform design goals and historical strategy decisions. Plaintiffs’ attorneys challenged him over past internal documents suggesting that Meta once tracked metrics related to user time spent on its apps, a key indicator critics use to argue the company prioritised engagement over safety. While Zuckerberg insisted that Meta has shifted away from those metrics in recent years, he stopped short of admitting that the platforms were engineered to intentionally create addictive behaviours.Another flashpoint in the courtroom was Instagram’s age-restriction enforcement. Zuckerberg reiterated that under-13 use is prohibited but also conceded that age verification is imperfect and that many young users misrepresent their birth years to gain access. Plaintiffs seized on this admission, arguing that Meta has known about underage engagement for years yet did not do enough to protect minors. Meta’s legal team countered by pointing to new safety features and protections rolled out in recent years, while asserting that external factors beyond their control contribute to how and why young people interact with social media.During testimony in the high-profile social media safety trial, Zuckerberg revealed that he personally reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss the “wellbeing of teens and kids” in the digital ecosystem. The Meta chief said that the conversation was part of broader efforts to explore how major tech platforms can work together to improve online safety standards, particularly for younger users. Zuckerberg framed the outreach as evidence that youth mental health and responsible product design have become cross-industry concerns, not just competitive talking points between Silicon Valley rivals.The disclosure is notable given the often tense relationship between Meta and Apple, especially after Apple’s privacy changes disrupted Meta’s advertising business. By invoking his dialogue with Cook, Zuckerberg appeared to signal that safeguarding minors transcends corporate rivalry. The testimony comes amid mounting scrutiny over how platforms like Instagram are designed and whether engagement-driven features disproportionately affect teens. His remarks suggest that behind the scenes, tech leaders may be engaging in conversations about shared accountability, even as their companies face growing legal and regulatory pressure in courtrooms and legislatures alike.This trial is not just a test of one company’s practices, it reflects a broader legal and cultural moment where society is questioning the role of social media in children’s lives. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other platforms and although companies like TikTok and Snap Inc. reached early settlements, Meta’s case has moved forward, making Zuckerberg’s testimony especially pivotal. Legal experts describe the case as potentially precedential, with far-reaching implications for how digital platforms must consider safety in their design and business decisions.Significantly, the trial parallels debates currently unfolding in governments around the world about regulating online spaces. Some lawmakers have called for stricter age controls, algorithmic transparency and safety mandates for social media companies. In the US, discussions over reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that broadly shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, have gained traction in light of cases like this one. A ruling against Meta could embolden calls for updated regulatory frameworks, while a defence victory might reinforce existing legal protections.The outcome of this trial could have multiple ripple effects. A decision against Meta could open the door for similar liability claims against other tech giants. Governments may feel increased urgency to legislate online child safety and enforce stricter age verification. Tech companies might re-examine features such as recommendation algorithms, engagement metrics and design choices linked to youth usage.The trial has amplified public discourse on the mental health impacts of social media, especially for vulnerable populations like teens and pre-teens. Critics liken this case to the Big Tobacco lawsuits of the past, where corporate design and marketing practices were scrutinised for contributing to widespread harm. If the jury finds Meta accountable or if significant evidence alters public perception, the digital landscape could face new standards of corporate responsibility and safety compliance.A landmark trial in Los Angeles is testing whether Meta’s social media platforms intentionally foster addictive use and harm children’s mental health. Mark Zuckerberg testified that while Meta prohibits under-13 users and has moved away from maximising screen time goals, age enforcement is challenging and the company disputes the core allegations. The lawsuit and thousands like it could reshape Big Tech liability, regulation and product design across the global digital ecosystem. The case is seen as a bellwether for future legal actions and regulatory reforms related to youth safety online.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm.

Looking ahead





With Ramadan starting on Wednesday, February 18, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially recalibrated the city’s pulse. To accommodate late-night prayers, family gatherings, and shorter office hours, Dubai’s transport network has shifted into high gear.Whether you're chasing the sunset for Iftar or heading to the Masjid for Taraweeh, here is everything you need to know to stay on track.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan, reflecting the city’s altered daily routines and travel rhythms.The timings cover both the Red Line and Green Line services, designed to match shifts in commuting patterns as residents fast, pray and gather throughout the month.These revised hours apply from the start of Ramadan, which authorities confirmed will begin around mid-February 2026. Travel patterns will adapt rapidly once fasting begins.These adjusted hours help residents navigate a month where early mornings and late evening activities are more common, particularly around Suhoor (pre-dawn) and Iftar (sunset breaking of fast).The extended Friday night service until 1 am reflects the city’s social rhythm, as many events and prayers occur later in the evening.Ramadan alters daily life in Dubai: work schedules shift earlier, fasting affects peak travel times, and evening social and religious activities extend late into the night.The RTA says the updated Metro schedule ensures greater convenience and service alignment with people’s needs, especially around prayer times, sunset, and Iftar gatherings.Alongside the Metro, other transport services also feature updated timings:These adjustments ensure public transport supports daily life throughout the fasting period and beyond sunset into the night.Parking in Dubai has received a thoughtful ""Iftar Break."" For 2026, the RTA has implemented a two-shift payment system for all paid zones from Monday to Saturday. This is designed to give your wallet a rest exactly when you need it most.As for Salik (Tolls), the peak hour rate of AED 6 applies from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, it drops to AED 4, and it is completely free between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, which is perfect for those traveling for early Suhoor.As Ramadan reshapes daily life across the city, Dubai Metro’s revised schedule ensures residents and visitors can move smoothly from early morning commutes to late-night gatherings.With extended Friday hours and adjusted weekday services, the new timings reflect the rhythm of the holy month, balancing work, worship and family time. Commuters are advised to plan journeys in advance and check official updates from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to avoid last-minute rushes during peak Iftar hours.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan.

Why the blue shirt trending now





In an era of viral gowns and headline-grabbing couture, it is not a crystal-encrusted dress or archival tiara setting the fashion agenda but a crisp, powder-blue button-down shirt. The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt.

"In New Zealand, a judge wrestles with AI-assisted apology",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-new-zealand-a-judge-wrestles-with-ai-assisted-apology/articleshow/128536265.cms,"Image: IANS





A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments.“The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. “Out of curiosity I punched into two AI tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing. “It became immediately apparent that these were two AI-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.”Judge Gilbert said he was not criticising the defendant’s use of AI. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript.The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in AI-assisted writing.Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies, eulogies and wedding vows inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans.Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said about the case.Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of AI use and users. Across the six studies Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use AI. “AI is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings suggest that people generally perceived those using AI as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful.The situation in the New Zealand court was a real-life test of the perceptions that the researchers sought to identify. “An AI could be perfectly trained on all apologies but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not authentic because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said.Judge Gilbert said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse. But he granted only a 5% reduction in the sentence. He sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison.","A New Zealand judge discovered that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence.

Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave



Cave microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels



Research reshapes search for extraterrestrial life



Extreme cave environments preserve early adaptations





Microbial communities hidden deep inside the caves of New Mexico have fascinated scientists who study extreme environments and search for extraterrestrial life. In 2018, the team of scientists at Carlsbad Caverns came across strange green colonies on the limestone walls, which were very far away from the natural light. Later, these microbes were confirmed to be cyanobacteria, which have the ability to conduct photosynthesis using near-infrared light. According to the study, these bacteria have existed in their present form for the last 4 to 9 million years. This discovery indicates that life is able to exist even under conditions that had been regarded as too dark to support life.The research, which was done by Hazel Barton of the University of Alabama and Lars Behrendt of Uppsala University, has a potential impact on biology and astrobiology. Besides that, it reveals how organisms modify themselves to survive with very low energy supplies in enclosed and low-light environments.The discovery was made in an alcove that appeared entirely black to the eye. When researchers shone a torch across the wall, a bright green layer became visible. The colour was striking against the stone. Laboratory testing showed the growth consisted of cyanobacteria, single-celled organisms often linked to surface environments where sunlight is present.What made this colony different was its location. The area receives no direct sunlight. It sits well beyond the cave entrance. Yet the microbes were active and stable.Further analysis revealed that these organisms contain chlorophyll d and chlorophyll f. These pigments allow absorption of near-infrared light, which sits beyond the range visible to humans. This form of light is faint and scattered. In the cave, it appears to reflect and diffuse from limestone surfaces in small amounts.The microbes use that limited energy to photosynthesise. The process works at lower light levels than previously recorded for similar organisms. It is not dramatic, but it is steady.The finding of the study, “Life in the dark: far-red absorbing cyanobacteria extend photic zones deep into terrestrial caves” , has drawn interest from astrobiologists. Understanding the minimum light conditions needed for photosynthesis helps define where life might survive elsewhere. If organisms can adapt to such restricted wavelengths, planets orbiting dimmer stars may remain possible targets.Hazel Barton has said the work aims to identify the longest wavelength and lowest intensity of light that can sustain photosynthesis. That boundary matters. It shapes telescope surveys and guides modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.Carlsbad Caverns provides a controlled setting, with stable temperature and little disturbance. The cyanobacteria appear to have adjusted over long periods to exploit scarce energy. The ecosystem is simple, almost quiet. There is no immediate suggestion of alien microbes waiting in the darkness. But the cave walls offer a reminder that life can persist where expectations narrow. It changes the margins slightly. Sometimes that is enough.","Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave. Microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels.

NEOM brine pools form a separate layer on the seafloor of Gulf of Aqaba



Life holds at the margins rather than inside

Sediment remains undisturbed in the absence of oxygen





The surface of the Gulf of Aqaba appears calm for most of the year, with little to suggest what sits far below. Nearly 1,800 metres down, researchers have identified a dense pool of highly saline water resting on the seafloor, separated from the surrounding Red Sea. The feature, known as the NEOM brine pools, covers roughly 10,000 square metres, with three smaller pools nearby. Scientists say the water inside is several times saltier than normal seawater and contains almost no oxygen. Because of its weight, the brine remains trapped in a basin, forming what researchers describe as an isolated underwater lake. The discovery adds to growing interest in deep sea brine pools and their role in preserving environmental records in tectonically active regions.The NEOM brine pools were mapped using remotely operated vehicles working at depth in the northern Red Sea. Video and sampling show a clear boundary between normal seawater and the darker, denser brine below. Salinity levels are estimated to be around four times higher than typical seawater. Oxygen is largely absent. Marine animals that stray into the pool appear disoriented and do not remain there for long. The water does not mix easily, so the basin acts as a contained body within the larger sea.According to the study, “Discovery of the deep-sea NEOM Brine Pools in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea"" , the centre of the pool is mostly empty of larger marine life. Conditions are too extreme. Animals that drift too far in appear stunned. At the edges, though, there is activity. Microbes cluster along the thin boundary where oxygenated seawater meets the brine. The chemistry shifts across just a short distance. Bacteria adapted to high salinity seem to thrive there. Small crustaceans have been seen feeding in that narrow strip.Researchers interested in extremophiles pay attention to such places. The environment is harsh but not entirely sterile. It resembles conditions that might have existed in older oceans. That comparison is cautious, not exact.Below the brine, the seabed looks layered and quiet. In most marine settings, worms and other organisms churn through mud and sand. Here, little moves. The lack of oxygen limits disturbance. Microbial communities appear concentrated along the boundary where normal seawater meets the brine. This narrow zone supports specialised bacteria adapted to low oxygen and high salinity. Small crustaceans and shell-forming organisms have also been observed nearby, feeding on microbial growth.Scientists studying extremophile microbes see these habitats as useful analogues for early Earth conditions. Cores taken from the bottom show thin bands of sediment stacked over time. The record may reach back around 1,200 years, though dating is still being refined. Some layers are thicker, composed of sand washed in from sudden floods or underwater landslides.","Researchers have identified a dense pool of highly saline water resting on the seafloor, separated from the surrounding Red Sea.

Aunties to play matchmakers for single Americans: Singapore’s new tourism campaign replaces dating apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/aunties-to-play-matchmakers-for-single-americans-singapores-new-tourism-campaign-replaces-dating-apps/articleshow/128522230.cms,"How Singapore’s new matchmaking campaign works



What the winners receive

Who can apply and key dates



Addressing online misinterpretation

Part of a broader tourism strategy

A history of state involvement in matchmaking





Singapore has launched a state-backed tourism campaign inviting single Americans to step away from dating apps and try human-led matchmaking, with so-called “aunties” selecting their first date instead of algorithms. The initiative, titled “Aunties, Not Algorithms,” is run by the Singapore Tourism Board and targets US residents aged 21 and above who are frustrated with modern app-based dating. Two selected participants will be paired for a blind date in Singapore, with flights, accommodation and a curated itinerary included. The campaign blends tourism promotion with dating culture, presenting Singapore as a destination built around human connection, food and shared experiences.Interested singles are required to submit an online application that includes personal details and a short video explaining why they should be chosen. Instead of using software or data-driven matching, applications are reviewed manually by a panel of “aunties”. After assessing the entries, the panel will select two individuals and match them for a first date in Singapore. The process is designed to emphasise intuition, personality and cultural compatibility rather than algorithms.The matchmaking panel consists of comedian Atsuko Okatsuka, astrologer and professional matchmaker Aliza Kelly, and Singaporean actor Tan Kheng Hua. In Singapore and across much of Asia, the term “auntie” is commonly used to describe older women who play informal advisory roles within families and communities, often offering guidance on relationships, careers and life decisions. In this campaign, the aunties act strictly as matchmakers and mentors.The selected pair will be flown to Singapore for a four-night stay. The prize package includes return flights, hotel accommodation and an “auntie-approved” itinerary designed to serve as a first date experience. Activities include a Singaporean cooking class with a Michelin-starred chef, along with curated food, cultural and sightseeing experiences intended to showcase the city’s culinary heritage and urban lifestyle.The campaign is open to single Americans aged 21 and above who are legal residents of the United States. Applicants must submit their entries before 13 March 2026, after which the panel will review submissions and select the final pair. The tourism board has said the campaign is limited to one matched couple.Following the campaign’s launch, some social media posts inaccurately suggested that Singapore was encouraging Americans to date older local women or promoting so-called “passport bro” culture. Media reports and official statements clarified that the aunties are not romantic participants but act only as matchmakers, guiding the pairing process and itinerary.The initiative aligns with Singapore’s wider tourism strategy, which increasingly uses pop culture, lifestyle content and experiential campaigns to attract visitors. In recent years, the tourism board has partnered with global artists and productions to feature Singapore in music videos and entertainment projects, using culture-led storytelling to boost international appeal.Government-supported matchmaking is not new in Singapore. In 1984, the government established the Social Development Unit to encourage social interaction and marriage amid concerns about declining birth rates. While that initiative focused on domestic demographics, the current campaign adopts a lighter and more playful approach, using matchmaking as a creative tool to promote tourism and cultural exchange rather than long-term social policy.","Singapore has launched a state-backed tourism campaign inviting single Americans to step away from dating apps and try human-led matchmaking.

What is changing with Salik toll fees in the UAE



Monday to Saturday



Dh6 (peak rate): 9 am – 5 pm

9 am – 5 pm Dh4 (off-peak rate): 7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am

7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am Free (off-peak): 2 am – 7 am

Sunday (excluding public holidays and events)



Dh4 (both peak and off-peak): 7 am – 2 am

7 am – 2 am Free: 2 am – 7 am

Why the Salik toll structure is changing in the UAE

Later starts and shorter days during Ramadan mean peak travel times often shift compared to the rest of the year.

Salik’s new timing accounts for this by extending lower toll periods into early evening and late night, periods when many residents are commuting for iftar (sunset fast-breaking) and evening prayers or social engagements.

Free toll hours in the early pre-dawn period (2 am – 7 am) support non-peak travel and reflect typical reduced road usage.

Quick takeaways for UAE drivers



Expect different Salik charges during Ramadan 2026, with peak hours now between 9 am and 5 pm.

Off-peak and late-night travel is cheaper or free, encouraging motorists to travel outside busy hours.

Adjust your commuting plans, especially around iftar and early mornings, to avoid unexpected toll charges.





With Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19), pending the official moon sighting on February 17, Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month. These updates aim to improve traffic flow and commuting comfort in line with altered work and school schedules across the city.Salik has introduced a variable pricing structure for toll gates during Ramadan 2026 to better align with expected traffic patterns:These adjustments reflect the shifted daily rhythm in Ramadan, where working hours and schooling usually start later and end earlier to accommodate fasting, prayer, and family time.The revised toll schedule is not simply about price, it is part of a broader strategy to smooth traffic flow across Dubai’s busiest routes during Ramadan:Similar adjustments have been reported in other transport and city services as part of Ramadan preparation, including variable parking timings and public transport schedule shifts. These toll changes come alongside wider seasonal shifts across the UAE as communities prepare for Ramadan.Work hours and school schedules are reduced or revised for the holy month to help residents observe fasting and prayer times comfortably. Other services like parking fees and public transit operations are also adjusted to better align with Ramadan routines. The adjustments aim to support both residents and visitors during what is one of the most significant months in the UAE’s cultural and religious calendar.As Ramadan approaches, keeping track of these changes can help drivers in the UAE plan trips more efficiently and avoid higher toll costs in peak windows.", Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19) Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month.

'Suicide’ was actually hit-and-run: Dubai Police use AI-powered digital twin to crack case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suicide-was-actually-hit-and-run-dubai-police-use-ai-powered-digital-twin-to-crack-case/articleshow/128412079.cms,"Dubai Police use advanced Digital Twin technology to digitally reconstruct crime scenes / AI image

Dubai Police solve hit-and-run with AI tech

What is “Digital Twin” tech?

Smart policing in the UAE





Dubai has once again stepped into the future of law enforcement. The Dubai Police General Department of Forensic Evidence and Criminology has officially integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.This cutting-edge system creates a precise, high-definition virtual replica of a physical crime scene. By using advanced 3D scanning and laser mapping, detectives can now move through a digital version of a room or outdoor area with millimeter accuracy.This means the original environment is ""frozen in time,"" allowing investigators to examine every corner of a scene without actually being there physically.In a striking example of 21st-century policing, Dubai Police used its new Digital Twin technology to overturn the initial conclusion in a bridge-fall incident involving a delivery rider. What first appeared to be a suicide quickly became a hit-and-run case after investigators digitally reconstructed the scene.Using highly detailed 3D modelling and virtual reality tools, officers discovered that the rider’s motorcycle had been struck from behind by another vehicle, causing him to fall from the bridge. The fleeing driver left no trace at the scene, but the Digital Twin analysis offered clear visual and scientific evidence to rewrite the narrative and reclassify the case as a crime rather than a tragic self-inflicted act.This wasn’t the only success for the system. Digital Twin also solved a structural collapse investigation involving a basement parking facility. What appeared to be a mysterious failure was revealed through advanced modelling as the result of repeated water leakage that weakened concrete supports over time. By simulating load stresses with scientific precision, police could pinpoint the exact mechanism of collapse.Unlike traditional forensic methods that rely solely on physical evidence and witness statements, Digital Twin builds a virtual replica of a crime scene using cutting-edge technology. This system merges 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics into a unified, interactive digital environment.Investigators can revisit this virtual scene at any time, examine evidence from multiple angles, test hypotheses, and even simulate possible sequences of events, all without returning physically to the location. The models are auditable, transparent and designed to support data-driven decision-making, making them especially valuable in courtrooms where evidence must withstand intense scrutiny.The Digital Twin process unfolds in three stages: first, the scene is digitally documented in full detail; then data is refined and enhanced; finally, advanced analytical tools produce intelligent models and outputs that help investigators understand what really happened.Since its rollout, the Digital Twin system has already clarified nearly 85 incidents, according to Dubai Police project managers. By virtually walking through these scenes, investigators can reduce errors, accelerate analysis time, and provide stronger, more reliable forensic conclusions in the judicial process.The Digital Twin initiative isn’t just innovative, it’s award-winning. The technology received a 7-star rating and was named Best Innovative Project at the International Best Practices Competition (IBPC) 2025, as well as winning the UAE Ideas Award 2025 in Smart Government and Digital Transformation.Senior police engineers highlight that Digital Twin is part of a broader strategy to embed technology and AI into all facets of law enforcement in Dubai. The goal is to make criminal investigations faster, more accurate, and more aligned with modern digital realities.This drive aligns with directives from leadership to position Dubai Police as a global leader in tech-powered law enforcement, a vision backed by investments in AI, virtual reality, and data analytics.","Dubai Police has integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.

Next eclipse coming in August





Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026. Known as an ""annular"" eclipse, it happens when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun, leaving a brilliant, fiery ring visible around its edges.However, for those of us in the UAE, there is a catch: the ""Path of Annularity"" is incredibly narrow and remote, sweeping almost exclusively over Antarctica.Because the alignment happens while the Sun is below our local horizon, the eclipse will be entirely invisible from the UAE sky. While we won’t see the sky go dark over the Burj Khalifa, the event remains a major global scientific milestone. Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026.The term “ring of fire” refers to the bright circle of sunlight that remains visible during an annular solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking sunlight. However, during an annular eclipse, the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth in its orbit.Because of this increased distance, the Moon appears smaller in the sky and cannot completely cover the Sun’s surface.Instead of plunging the sky into darkness like a total solar eclipse, a thin, brilliant ring of sunlight surrounds the Moon’s dark silhouette.This glowing halo creates the dramatic “ring of fire” effect that captivates skywatchers. Unlike a total solar eclipse, an annular eclipse never produces full darkness because a portion of the Sun always remains visible. During the February 17, 2026 event, this striking ring effect will last for up to about two minutes and twenty seconds at peak viewing locations.Just because you can't see it from your balcony doesn't mean you have to miss the show. Since the eclipse unfolds in one of the most desolate places on Earth, several space agencies and research stations in Antarctica are preparing to share the view.If February feels like a missed opportunity, there is good news. A total solar eclipse will occur on August 12, 2026, visible across parts of Europe including Spain and Iceland. While it will still not be visible from the UAE, it is geographically closer and may attract eclipse chasers from the region planning travel.Additionally, 2026 will feature other astronomical highlights, including lunar eclipses and meteor showers that may be visible from UAE skies.","The first solar eclipse of 2026 will occur on February 17, 2026.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","UAE has announced a strategic global partnership with Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX.

Dubai City Walk: A post-iftar social hub for Ramadan 2026



What this means for Dubai residents and visitors





As Ramadan 2026 begins from February 19 or 20, 2026, Dubai is rolling out one of its most ambitious celebration calendars yet, blending traditional spiritual observances with city-wide visual spectacles designed to unite residents, visitors and families after iftar every evening. From night-sky drone light shows to cultural installations and community gatherings, the emirate is turning Ramadan into a vibrant festival of light, art and shared experience under the stars.One of the standout features of Dubai’s 2026 Ramadan calendar is its coordinated drone light shows, which will illuminate the night sky with artistic formations inspired by the holy month. These shows are more than just pretty visuals; they are thematic stories expressed through technology that reflect Ramadan’s spirit of reflection, community and renewal.The drone displays will run nightly from February 19 to March 19, inviting audiences across the city to look up and engage with light as a medium of cultural storytelling. Dubai’s use of drones, a hallmark of its contemporary festival culture, represents a fusion of tradition and innovation in public celebrations.In addition to drones, fireworks displays will enliven key locations like Al Seef and Dubai Creek throughout Ramadan, creating shared moments of spectacle shortly after sunset.These fireworks, timed for post-iftar evenings, are designed to enhance the festive ambience of the season and give families and communities something to look forward to each night.The combination of fireworks and drones mirrors Dubai’s approach to past celebrations, like New Year’s Eve events and shopping festivals, where visual performances play a central role in citywide gatherings.Beyond aerial shows, Dubai is hosting “Ramadan Reflections (Atyaf Ramadaniyah)”, a large-scale series of visual and cultural installations across 10 public locations, including Al Seef and Dubai Festival City Mall. These spaces will feature artistic expressions, from light sculptures to narrative art, that evoke the soulful essence of Ramadan through reflection and ambience.These installations are designed to complement evening routines: prayer, iftar, family walks, and community interactions. Residents can explore themed exhibits while strolling or dining, making the evenings both reflective and energising.Another highlight on the Ramadan calendar is the evening programming at City Walk, which opens its space to extended entertainment, dining and cultural interaction from February 17 to March 18. With ambient décor and a relaxed atmosphere, City Walk aims to be a central post-iftar gathering spot where friends and families connect over food and cultural activities.This initiative reflects Dubai’s broader effort to balance spiritual observance with inclusive social experiences, particularly in open-air venues where residents can enjoy the cooler night air and Ramadan ambience together.Dubai’s festive calendar, combining religious tradition with modern spectacle, highlights how the city embraces Ramadan as both a sacred period of reflection and an opportunity to bring communities together. The nightly drone shows and fireworks provide unifying moments that encourage shared city experiences, while installations and social spaces foster deeper cultural engagement.For visitors and new residents, this calendar offers a unique way to experience Ramadan, not just through mosque attendance and family iftars but through public art, technology displays and communal evenings that echo with celebration and meaning. Dubai’s approach exemplifies how global cities are reimagining Ramadan: honouring religious devotion while incorporating cutting-edge entertainment and cultural expression.The use of technology (like drones), combined with age-old communal values, gives this year’s celebration a distinctive flavour that reflects both innovation and heritage. Whether watching the night sky light up with synchronised drones, enjoying fireworks over the creek or exploring illuminated installations around the city, the Ramadan 2026 calendar invites everyone in Dubai to share in experiences that spark joy, reflection and connection.From drone shows and fireworks to cultural installations and lively evening venues, Dubai’s Ramadan 2026 calendar is shaping up to be one of the most visually and socially engaging yet, bringing modern spectacle to a time of sacred tradition and community celebration.","Ramadan 2026 begins on February 19 or 20, 2026.

Many residents are embracing active lifestyles, even during fasting, opting for night-time walks, jogging and social sports after iftar, a trend also seen in urban sports arenas and public parks. Cultural Immersion: For expats and long-term residents alike, iftar hikes offer a meaningful way to engage with the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan beyond traditional indoor gatherings. They provide a fresh perspective on fasting, blending silence, reflection and nature, while fostering new friendships across diverse communities.

Are UAE's Ramadan Iftar Hikes the New Spiritual Escape?





As Ramadan 2026 unfolds, a rising trend among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is capturing attention: iftar hikes or organised group treks in the Hajar Mountains and desert landscapes where people break their fast together in nature’s calm, far from city life. What began as informal outings has evolved into a vibrant seasonal ritual that blends spiritual reflection, community bonding and healthy outdoor activity against stunning backdrops as the sun sets.Across the UAE, hiking groups are increasingly scheduling mountain treks timed around iftar (sunset), when fasting Muslims break their fast with dates, water and light meals after a day of fasting. Hikers gather with backpacks instead of dining tables an hour before sunset, reaching trails or scenic vantage points by the call to prayer and enjoying a simple, shared moment before continuing their adventure.Organised groups like UAE Adventures Team and Outdoorzy Adventures have been running these experiences for several years, particularly in cooler winter months leading into Ramadan when outdoor temperatures are friendlier for physical activity. These outings prioritise accessibility, offering easy-to-moderate hikes in places like Fossil Rock in Mleiha and other elevated trails where panoramic views enrich the fast-breaking moment.According to some UAE Muslims, there is something uniquely meaningful about breaking the fast outdoors, away from everyday distractions and electronic devices. The simplicity of sharing dates and water with fellow hikers at sunset, followed by prayers in nature, resonates deeply with many. As one group founder put it, iftar hikes offer “a rare pause”, a moment to feel connected to both community and the spiritual spirit of Ramadan.Many journeys continue after the initial breaking of the fast: groups pause for Maghrib prayer, then hike for a few more hours under the night sky and sometimes finish the evening with suhoor barbecues or meals overlooking the mountains. The emphasis, hikers explain, is not on strenuous exercise but on shared experience, contemplation and fellowship, aligning outdoor adventure with the values of generosity and togetherness that define Ramadan.Unlike typical organised sports or fitness trends, iftar hikes are rooted in cultural adaptation and community spirit. They are scheduled with consideration for fasting participants, often starting after taraweeh prayers so there is ample time to digest iftar before physical exertion and they tend to be small, capped at 25–30 people for safety, especially when hiking after dark.Groups usually include both fasting and non-fasting participants, with organisers mindful to respect the needs of those observing the fast, for example, non-fasting hikers refrain from drinking water in front of others during the hike.Several factors are helping fuel the popularity of iftar hikes during Ramadan -Organisers of iftar hikes emphasise safety, especially since many hikes continue after dark. Small group sizes, often no more than 25 to 30 participants, help ensure that leaders can manage the risk of night hiking in rugged terrain. Participants are also briefed on safety protocols and trail conditions ahead of time.Given the varied terrain of the UAE’s Hajar Mountains including peaks like Jebel Al Mebrah and Jabal Qada’ah in Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, hikers are advised to come prepared with appropriate gear, flashlights or headlamps, and a plan for hydration once iftar is officially called.Iftar hikes are part of a broader social shift in the UAE during Ramadan where residents embrace outdoor and community-focused activities. For example, many people choose to exercise after iftar by jogging, playing football or visiting public spaces, turning late evenings into a hub for wellness and social connection. Likewise, community programmes like Umm Al Emarat Park’s Ramadan Nights events showcase how outdoor gatherings are now an integral part of the UAE’s Ramadan experience, combining cultural celebration with family-friendly engagement under the night sky.In 2026, iftar hikes have emerged as a symbolic expression of how people in the UAE are reimagining Ramadan traditions. They offer a blend of reflection, fitness, community spirit and adventure that complements the core values of the holy month. Far from being merely a fitness fad, these hikes reflect a deeper desire to connect with nature, share meaningful moments and embrace the spiritual essence of Ramadan with one sunset, one trail, one shared meal at a time.","Ramadan falls during a cool winter period in the UAE in 2026, making mountain and desert hikes more comfortable than in summer months.

Viral diving video turns dangerous: Oman issues urgent warning after man swims with killer whale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/viral-diving-video-turns-dangerous-oman-issues-urgent-warning-after-man-swims-with-killer-whale/articleshow/128372073.cms,"Viral Whale Video Sparks Safety Alert: Oman Authorities Say This Could Be Deadly

Why the Oman orca whale advisory came now: Viral video sparks concern



Orca whale behaviour and marine safety in Oman



Oman guidelines for viewing marine wildlife safely



Observe marine life from a boat or a safe distance rather than attempting to approach in the water.

Avoid diving or swimming near large marine mammals, especially orcas, which can swim quickly and unpredictably.

Let sightings be a moment of appreciation rather than an excuse for risky behaviour.

Marine encounters in Oman: A rare but captivating sight



What this means for divers and tourists in Oman







Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) after a video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online. The authority cautioned residents and visitors that attempting to approach or film these powerful animals up close is unsafe and unpredictable and could jeopardise both human lives and wildlife wellbeing.The advisory comes in response to a widely shared video that showed an individual diving close to an orca off the Omani coast in an apparent effort to film it underwater. According to local authorities, such behaviour is “incorrect and poses a serious risk to personal safety.”The Environment Authority of Oman explained that orcas, also known as killer whales, are wild animals with unpredictable behaviour and immense strength. They emphasised that orcas are not trained animals and approaching them closely in their natural habitat can trigger defensive or aggressive responses if the animals feel threatened.Orca whales (Orcinus orca) are among the most powerful predators in the ocean, known for their intelligence, cooperative hunting and dominance within marine ecosystems. While attacks on humans in the wild are rare, experts and wildlife agencies worldwide stress that close encounters with orcas should be avoided for safety reasons.The Oman warning echoes similar guidance that authorities and conservation groups give in other parts of the world, where orca sightings attract attention but require strict distance and respect to avoid startling or provoking the animals.To balance public interest with wildlife protection, Oman’s Environment Authority urged people to:This is not only a safety measure for humans but also supports the well-being of wildlife, since close human presence can disrupt natural behaviour or stress animals.Orca sightings in the Arabian Sea and Gulf region, including off the coasts of Oman and the UAE, are relatively uncommon, making them notable when they occur. Previous reports have even documented orca sightings near UAE waters, which sparked interest from conservationists and the general public alike.While orcas are not common in the Arabian Gulf, they have been seen periodically, highlighting the importance of coastal conservation efforts and public awareness around marine life.Oman’s advisory serves as a reminder to snorkellers, divers, and marine enthusiasts that wildlife encounters are best experienced cautiously and respectfully. Even curious or awe-inspiring moments should not override basic safety principles, especially with large predators that can weigh several tonnes and move unpredictably.Authorities are using the viral incident as a teaching moment where while technology and social media encourage close-up footage, safety for both humans and animals should always come first. As orca sightings capture public imagination, Oman’s Environment Authority has stepped in with a clear message: watch from afar, respect wildlife and never dive near a wild predator for a viral clip. Encouraging safe, sustainable ways to enjoy the ocean not only protects people but also preserves the natural behaviour and habitat of marine giants like the orca whale.",Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) A video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online.

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizeable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days. The widely circulated video was created by Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.With a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated AI videos, often shoddy clips known as AI slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood's top organisations and companies.Rhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his ""Deadpool"" films, said that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a ""cold shiver"" up his spine. ""For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it's nothing short of terrifying,"" he remarked. ""I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.""ByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger.A news release from the company praised the updated tool's ""physical accuracy, realism and controllability,"" which it said was suitable for the needs of ""professional-grade creative scenarios.""Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chair and CEO of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to ""immediately cease its infringing activity,"" saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorised use of copyrighted works on a ""massive scale.""Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using AI ""with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,"" said that unauthorised works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the ""most basic aspects of personal autonomy.""Disney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI's Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a ""pirated library"" of Disney's characters - ""as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.""ByteDance said it was aware of the concerns about Seedance. ""We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users,"" it said.Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication.

Disney Jr probably expected giggles and glitter when it introduced a new pint-sized superhero on— but happened something unexpected. Episode 8 of the animated series unveiled “Captain Durag,” a caped crusader meant to celebrate Black culture but now accused by critics of leaning into stereotypes.What was designed as playful representation has instead ignited a fierce online debate, particularly as the episode rolled out during Black History Month.According to the show’s premise, ""Hey AJ! is a high-energy adventure comedy about a curious and extremely imaginative 7-year-old girl, AJ.""The superhero was shown wearing a durag covering his face as a mask and a purple superhero outfit with a cape. In the show, the superhero had his own show and became an inspiration for AJ. Captain Durag taught her how to clean her room and fold her clothes, International Business Times reported.Creators argued it was representation, but critics objected to the portrayal. In the show, Captain Durag’s lore was that he was a superhero who took care of Slime City by cleaning trash and fighting off trash monsters.In an X post by user Dom Lucre | Breaker of Narratives (@dom_lucre), they wrote that ""Many Black Americans feel this is extremely disrespectful and even more so during Black History Month.""On TikTok, content creator Eli (elijxhvega) criticised the show. He said, ""Is Captain Durag supposed to be some type of representation? Like, am I missing something? This isn't what we meant when we said we wanted black superheroes without electricity powers!

I don't think we should be belittling jobs that make our society run.""Corbet also posted on TikTok and encouraged everyone to ""take a deep breath together and let's release ourselves from the shackles of respectability politics,"" and added that the black culture finally has a superhero.She said, ""Where's the joy? Why is everything so serious? We gotta celebrate our people.""She asked, ""And what was better than using a durag?

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.
