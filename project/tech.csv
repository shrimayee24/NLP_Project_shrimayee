In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset. In a LinkedIn post that raised plenty of eyebrows, he praised the software giant's ""refreshingly low-ego yet bursting with ambition"" ethos, throwing shade at Google's high-pressure environment. As corporate VP of AI, he contributed to foundation models powering Copilot, the enterprise chatbot embedded in Office and Azure.Both Microsoft and Google are led by Indian-Americans – Satya Nadella and Sundar Picha- – but Subramanya’s stint outside Seattle lasted less than six months before Tim Cook lured him back to Silicon Valley.For Apple, reeling from AI stumbles, Subramanya is a strategic antidote. The company's Apple Intelligence suite, unveiled in October 2024, has faltered: notification summaries spawned fabricated headlines, from false reports of a suspect's suicide to premature sports victories to Netanyahu’s arrest, drawing ire and lawsuits. Siri's promised overhaul—touted for contextual awareness and app control—languished after internal tests flopped, delaying rollout to spring 2026.Giannandrea, like Subramanya a Google import who once led Machine Intelligence, is said to have fostered research but struggled with product delivery. His 2024 paper on ""large-reasoning models"" critiqued AI's simulated cognition, yet Apple's outputs lagged. Now, with Giannandrea advising until spring, Subramanya will report to software SVP Craig Federighi, tasked with accelerating a 1-trillion-parameter in-house model while leaning on Apple’s upcoming $1 billion licensing deal with Gemini to revive Siri – delicious irony in the Apple-Google feud spanning maps to mobile.","Amar Subramanya is a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft.

India’s new cooperative app-based taxi platform — billed as the world’s first national mobility service fully owned by drivers — has become the largest driver-run mobility collective anywhere, even before its full rollout.Sahakar Taxi Cooperative Limited, which promotes the Bharat Taxi brand, enrolled more than 51,000 drivers across New Delhi and Gujarat’s Saurashtra region in just 10 days, surpassing New York’s The Driver’s Cooperative, launched in 2020 with roughly 4,000 members.Tuesday marked a milestone as beta consumer trials began in Delhi, allowing everyday users to test the Bharat Taxi app — now live on Google Play — while drivers activate real-time services. In plain terms: beta trials let riders and drivers use the platform under close monitoring, enabling developers to fix glitches and improve features before a full-scale release. An iOS version is expected soon.“The response is overwhelming,” said Jayen Mehta, chairman of Sahakar Taxi Cooperative Ltd. At the heart of the model is a zero-commission structure.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to the Trash folder and stay there for up to 30 days before automatically disappearing. However, they still count towards your total storage until the Trash is emptied manually. The same rule applies to the Spam folder as well. By opening each folder and choosing the option to permanently delete all items together, users can often free up a surprising amount of valuable storage space almost instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow.

"No phones, no smartwatches: Singapore tightens school rules; devices to be locked away from 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/no-phones-no-smartwatches-singapore-tightens-school-rules-devices-to-be-locked-away-from-2026/articleshow/125710932.cms,"



Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

Qatar's Hayya Visa upgrade

Two months and multiple entries

Extended Stay: Residents of GCC nations (including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait) can now stay in Qatar for up to two months (60 days) on a single Hayya visa application. This extended duration provides ample time for visitors to explore cultural sites, natural attractions, and the packed calendar of year-round events.



Multiple-Entry Access: The new visa grants multiple-entry access. This means visitors can travel in and out of Qatar throughout the season without needing to reapply each time, greatly facilitating short, frequent trips for events or weekend getaways from neighboring countries.



What is the Hayya Platform?

Integrated Services: Hayya integrates visa processing with other essential travel elements, including event access, accommodation booking, transport planning, and general lifestyle services



Official Entry Document: Originally launched for the 2022 FIFA World Cup , the Hayya system successfully processed entry permits for millions of fans, and it continues to serve as the mandatory entry document for specified categories of visitors, including those utilizing the new GCC Resident Visa (A2).



Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf. These changes, which officially took effect on November 30, 2025, are specifically designed to support the expected surge in regional visitors and streamline entry during Qatar's busy season of international events.The updates, announced by Qatar Tourism in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, aim to reinforce the country’s position as a regional tourism hub. They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks. They reflect Qatar Tourism's ""broader vision to strengthen the country's openness to the region, facilitate visitor movement during major sports and cultural events, increase arrivals, and enhance tourism's contribution to the national economy.",Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2) Residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity.

Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.

Twitch under fire as Asmongold demands Amazon intervention over Nina Lin controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/twitch-under-fire-as-asmongold-demands-amazon-intervention-over-nina-lin-controversy/articleshow/125727143.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Twitch under pressure as Asmongold urges Amazon oversight amid Nina Lin fallout

“the final straw”





Twitch has once again landed in the center of a major moderation scandal, with prominent streamer Asmongold calling on Amazon to take direct control of the platform following a series of alarming incidents involving IRL broadcaster Nina Lin. In recent months, Nina has drawn criticism for multiple on-stream actions that appeared to violate Twitch’s policies, but the latest flashpoint came when she was filmed shoplifting steaks from a store during a livestream. Viewers were quick to note that this was only the most recent addition to a pattern of troubling behavior, yet the resulting punishment remained unusually light.The escalation has reignited long-standing debates over Twitch’s inconsistent enforcement. Asmongold, who simulcasts on both Twitch and Kick, argued that the platform’s moderation under CEO Dan Clancy has become fundamentally unreliable. According to him, creators committing minor verbal violations or avatar guideline breaches often receive harsher penalties than streamers whose offenses occur in the real world, live on camera. The disparity has left portions of the community frustrated and calling for clearer rules and stronger leadership from Amazon’s corporate branch.At the center of the controversy is Nina Lin’s recent shoplifting episode, which Asmongold described asfollowing previous on-stream incidents, including touching male streamers without consent and allegations involving a minor. While multiple clips document these behaviors, Nina reportedly received only short suspensions rather than a permanent ban. Critics argue that such leniency signals favoritism, suggesting that certain streamers benefit from their profitability or visibility while smaller creators face stricter consequences for comparatively minor slip-ups.Asmongold believes Twitch’s current moderation structure is incapable of course correction without external pressure. He directly blamed Clancy and the platform’s Safety teams for enabling inconsistent rule enforcement, claiming Amazon needs to step in to restore trust. Industry analysts, however, remain skeptical that Amazon will intervene unless the controversy escalates into mainstream media coverage or regulatory concern. Historically, the tech giant has allowed Twitch to operate with broad autonomy.With tensions rising and community frustration mounting, the Nina Lin controversy highlights deeper structural issues that have plagued Twitch for years. Whether Amazon steps in or not, the platform faces growing demands for transparency, fairness, and a moderation system capable of handling unpredictable IRL content.Also Read: Why MeatCanyon was banned and unbanned on Twitch in November 2025",Nina Lin was filmed shoplifting steaks from a store during a livestream.

Tips to avoid accumulating black points





Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car. Avoid using your mobile phone while driving. Follow parking rules and avoid blocking fire hydrants or reserved spaces. Be extra cautious near school zones and bus stops. Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

Creators: Creators under 16 will no longer be able to sign in to YouTube, upload videos or manage their channels, and their channels will no longer be viewable.





Google’s video streaming platform YouTube has now announced that it will comply with Australia’s landmark law which will ban children under 16 years of age from various social media platforms. This announcement made by YouTube ends weeks of uncertainty over whether YouTube would challenge its inclusion in the ban. “This is a disappointing update to share. We deeply care about the safety of kids and teens on our platform; it’s why we spent more than a decade building robust protections and parental controls that families rely on for a safer YouTube experience. But as we have consistently said, this rushed regulation misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it. Most importantly, this law will not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube. We’ve heard from parents and educators who share these concerns,” said YouTube in a blog post.The Australian government is pushing ahead with a law, set to come into effect in December, that will require social media giants like Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Snapchat, and TikTok to implement ""reasonable steps"" to block under-16s from their platforms.Companies failing to comply could face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).Starting December 19, 2025, all the Australian users under the age of 16 years will be automatically signed out of their YouTube accounts. They will not be able to upload, comment, like any videos or subscribe to any channel. However, they will still be able to watch videos on YouTube without signing in. The full account access for these users will get restored only once they turn 16.The Australian government has defended the ban as necessary to protect children from harmful content, online predators, and mental health risks. Initially, YouTube was exempt due to its educational role, but lawmakers later included the platform to ensure fairness across all major digital services.As the law takes effect on December 10, we will make changes to how YouTube works in Australia.","YouTube will comply with Australia’s landmark law which will ban children under 16 years of age from various social media platforms.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B





Tech billionaire Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation, arguing that rapid advances in video games and AI now make the idea hard to ignore.In a recent interview with Nikhil Kamath, Musk explained his view by pointing to how games have moved from basic screens like Pong, “two rectangles and a square batting back and forth”, to today’s photo-realistic, real-time games played by millions.Musk said that if this trend continues, games will one day be impossible to distinguish from real life, with highly intelligent characters built into them. That, he argued, raises the possibility that our own reality could be a simulation.This is not the first time Musk has shared this belief. Years ago, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he made a similar argument.""If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilisation will end. One of those two things will occur,"" Musk said, adding, ""Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation, because we exist.""The idea he refers to is known as the “simulation hypothesis,” a long-running debate in philosophy and science. The concept suggests that a technologically advanced civilisation could create countless simulated worlds, and the people inside them would struggle to know what is real.","Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation.

In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Right now, if you have a thought of a brief, you could put that into Gemini Live. It will triangulate that brief with the insights we're seeing in the social sphere, what we're hearing from YouTube, and what we're seeing from our insights team.

I always write a brief, and I ask, ‘What would a cynical consumer say?’ and it tells me a story that I might not have thought about. What's interesting about the kind of talent we need is that it has to be a curious talent that isn't afraid of AI, but instead harnesses it to create better outputs and outcomes for the organization.

We're using

Veo 3

, our own product, to shoot every concept before we go to market. We literally have shaved 15 weeks off the go-to-market process because we know how to harness our own Google tools. But we have people on our side of the fence that actually want to lean in, and you know, there's a lot of trial, there's a lot of error, a lot of teaching the model on how we want to think about the world.

However, this is a once-in-a-generation moment where we are shaping the future tools.”

What the Google VP said about her own Pixel team

“The

Google Pixel team

is extremely bullish and excited to bring our new products to market.

Whether it's through creativity, products like

Nano Banana

— that broke the App Store because it's been so well-received — all the way through to everyday productivity tools, we're seeing our consumers lean in and understand how to harness our devices in ways they cannot with our competitors.

As I always tell our team, as a challenger, we are the underdog in this game, but it's the best place to be in order to punch above our weight, show consumers what's possible.”
