Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life. Lose four lives, and it’s game over.Use these hints to help form the correct groups:(Think of events that involve dancing, music, or big gatherings.)(Consider words that relate to someone's personality, essence or internal makeup.)(You might hear these on a scale or in a recipe — pre-metric system units.)(A beauty product, a type of marble, a celestial object and a type of eyewear style.)BASHBLASTBLOWOUTRAVEThese are all terms used to describe large, energetic parties or celebrations.CHARACTERFIBERMAKEUPNATUREEach of these words can refer to the fundamental qualities or essence of a person or thing.DRAMOUNCEPOUNDSTONEAll are units of weight commonly used in the imperial measurement system, particularly in the UK.EYELINER (a type of makeup styled as a cat-eye)GLASSES (as in lenses shaped or styled like a cat’s eye)MARBLE (cat’s eye marbles are a specific type of toy marble)NEBULA (as in the Cat’s Eye Nebula, a famous astronomical object)If you were thrown off by the group involving MAKEUP, EYELINER and BLOWOUT, you’re not alone—it was easy to assume a beauty-related category.

"Microsoft Layoffs: Microsoft's fired AI director to 6,000 laid off employees along with her: ""These are people who…""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsofts-fired-ai-director-to-6000-laid-off-employees-along-with-her-these-are-people-who/articleshow/121245726.cms,"Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including AI Director Gabriela de Queiroz. As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel. The disruptions appear to have been organised by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid'.","Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies.

""We're not sure what fell on them, but it just completely took their arms off.""In the aftermath, Paul Klein immediately turned to his wife, repeating their wedding vows through tears.""They are the definition of true love,"" Baker stated. ""They are so sweet.

Why Southwest Airlines bans portable chargers in carry-on bags,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-southwest-airlines-bans-portable-chargers-in-carry-on-bags/articleshow/121359490.cms,"Southwest Airlines’ argument for banning portable chargers



FAA and TSA rules vs. Southwest’s new policy

A growing safety concern in the skies



What passengers need to know

Keep power banks in a seat pocket or on the tray table when charging.

Ensure the device is powered off when stored in bags.

Never place active charging devices inside carry-ons or overhead bins.





S outhwest Airlines has become the first US carrier to enforce a new rule prohibiting passengers from using portable chargers (power banks) inside carry-on bags during flights. Effective 28 May, the policy is a response to rising safety concerns about lithium-ion batteries, which can overheat or catch fire mid-air. While power banks will still be allowed in carry-ons, they must remain powered off and in plain sight, such as in seat pockets or on tray tables, when in use. The goal, Southwest says, is to ensure quick access and fast intervention in emergencies to protect passengers and crew alike. The airline says the move exceeds current FAA guidelines, aiming to prevent in-flight lithium battery fires. Similar bans have been introduced internationally following recent aircraft incidents.Southwest Airlines’ decision to restrict the use of portable chargers inside carry-on bags is rooted in growing safety concerns over lithium-ion batteries. These batteries, found in everyday devices like smartphones, laptops and portable power banks, pose a well-documented risk of overheating.When a lithium battery overheats, it can enter a hazardous state known as thermal runaway, in which the battery experiences a rapid, uncontrollable increase in temperature and pressure. This process can release flammable gases, potentially leading to smoke, fire or even explosions within the confined environment of an aircraft cabin.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tracked 620 lithium-related fire incidents on US flights since 2006, with 240 of those involving portable battery packs specifically. These alarming statistics support Southwest’s position that passengers should not charge devices from inside carry-on luggage, where overheating could go unnoticed until it becomes a serious threat. By requiring that power banks be visible, placed in a seat pocket or on a tray table, Southwest believes flight crews can respond more quickly in emergencies, helping to prevent injuries and minimise damage. The airline maintains that this visibility is key to fast intervention, and ultimately, to the safety of everyone onboard.Current FAA and TSA regulations already ban power banks from checked baggage but allow them in carry-ons. However, Southwest is taking a stricter stance by requiring power banks to be visible and not actively charging devices while inside bags. This visibility allows for quicker response in the event of overheating or fire. It is a proactive step beyond existing federal guidance, similar to measures taken by Air Busan after a devastating fire incident earlier this year.The frequency of these incidents is rising. In 2024, the FAA recorded 81 lithium-battery-related events, an average of 1.6 per week. In one instance, a fire on an American Airlines flight in April 2025 forced an emergency landing after a power bank ignited. In January, a phone caught fire aboard a United Airlines flight, prompting the use of a thermal containment bag to prevent further damage.Passengers flying Southwest after 28 May should:As personal electronic devices become more common, the risks associated with their lithium-ion batteries increase. Southwest Airlines’ new policy is designed to reduce onboard hazards by requiring portable chargers to be visible and powered off during flights. Though this may inconvenience some travellers, the rule reflects a broader shift in aviation towards prioritising safety over convenience. With incidents of battery overheating on the rise, the airline’s proactive stance underscores the need for vigilance in managing emerging tech-related threats in the cabin. Ultimately, the policy aims to protect passengers and crew from the growing dangers posed by modern portable electronics.","Southwest Airlines has become the first US carrier to enforce a new rule prohibiting passengers from using portable chargers (power banks) inside carry- on bags during flights.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Google Veo 3 related FAQs

What is

Google Veo 3

and how is it different from older versions?

Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

How can I access Google Veo 3 and what does it cost?

It is currently available in the U.S. via the Gemini app’s Ultra plan for $249.99/month and through Vertex AI for enterprise users.

Can Veo 3 replace human filmmakers?

Not entirely. While Veo 3 is powerful, it serves as a tool for creative augmentation, not a total replacement for human storytelling, direction, or emotion.

When will Veo 3 launch in India?

No official date yet, but Google is expected to expand to India soon, especially with high creator interest.

In a historic announcement at Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled its most ambitious AI video generation model to date: Veo 3. This latest iteration marks a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, blurring the boundaries between human-created and machine-generated content. What sets Veo 3 apart is not just its ability to create strikingly realistic visuals from simple text prompts, but its newly introduced capability to generate synchronized audio—dialogue, background noise, music, and ambient sound—all in one seamless output.For decades, the dream of creating cinematic experiences through AI has remained largely in the realm of science fiction. Today, Veo 3 transforms that dream into a tangible reality. Designed for content creators, educators, marketers, and filmmakers, Veo 3 dramatically lowers the barrier to professional-grade video production. With just a few words, users can generate rich, immersive videos that would have previously required a crew, equipment, and significant post-production resources. The implications are immense, not only for entertainment but for education, journalism, business, and beyond.Google’s Veo 3 is the third and most advanced version of its generative video model. Unlike its predecessor, Veo 2, which could only create silent video clips, Veo 3 adds the missing piece: natural-sounding, context-aware audio. This includes:This fusion of sound and vision results in an experience that is eerily close to real life. One of Veo 3’s key differentiators is its ability to synchronize lip movements with dialogue, making characters in the video appear convincingly human. Furthermore, it understands context. For example, if a user inputs the prompt: ""a thunderstorm at sea with a ship struggling against the waves,"" the result is a cinematic video complete with storm sounds, creaking wood, and urgent narration—entirely AI-generated.Veo 3 is built upon a foundation of multimodal AI, combining natural language processing (NLP), text-to-video diffusion models, and text-to-speech synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Key features include:Google’s use of its Gemini Ultra foundation model also enables Veo 3 to understand nuanced instructions such as tone of voice, cinematic mood, or specific cultural settings.Since its debut, creators have flocked to Veo 3 to explore its capabilities. Viral content quickly surfaced across social platforms like X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok.As of May 2025, Veo 3 is available exclusively in the United States and only for premium subscribers. Access is granted through:It’s also integrated into Google’s Vertex AI suite, making it available for enterprise-level customers, media studios, and advertising agencies. While this price point is clearly aimed at serious professionals, Google has hinted at future pricing models that could allow broader access, especially as demand scales.What makes Veo 3 more than just a tool is the democratization of creativity it enables. For decades, creating even a short professional video required expensive equipment, a team of specialists, and post-production work. With Veo 3, creators now just need an idea and a few sentences.This shift redefines how we approach storytelling. Students can create history projects that look like documentaries. Small businesses can produce polished ads without agencies. Independent filmmakers can prototype entire scenes before investing in production.Google also touts Veo 3’s educational potential, especially in multilingual regions. The model can render the same video in different languages with native-style voiceovers, offering powerful tools for global teaching and accessibility.Currently, there is no confirmed timeline for Veo 3’s global rollout, including availability in India. However, given the country’s booming content creation economy and rising adoption of generative AI, industry watchers expect India to be among the first wave of international markets.In the meantime, Google is working to expand infrastructure and compliance for its Vertex AI and Gemini platforms in Asia. Localization support, including regional languages, could be a key part of Veo 3’s expansion strategy.As with any powerful AI tool, Veo 3 raises questions around:Google claims to have embedded robust watermarking and usage detection systems to combat misuse. Additionally, all content generated with Veo 3 includes metadata tags for AI attribution. Still, ongoing discussions about ethics and regulation are likely to follow Veo’s broader adoption.","Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

Multiple protests at Microsoft Build 2025 conference

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Microsoft has terminated the software engineer who interrupted CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote speech at the company’s annual developer conference – Build 2025. Joe Lopez, the fired employee, protested against the company’s partnership with the Israeli military amid the war in Gaza, shouting “Free Palestine”. “How about you show them how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show them how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” Lopez shouted from the audience before being confronted and dragged out of the Seattle Convention Center by security. “As a Microsoft worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide,” he yelled.According to advocacy group, “No Azure for Apartheid,"" Lopez received a termination letter following the protest, although he was reportedly unable to open the document.Shortly after the protest, Lopez sent a mass email to Microsoft colleagues challenging the company’s statements about the use of its Azure cloud services in Gaza. “Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza”, he said.“Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians.”The incident marked the first of multiple pro-Palestinian protests during the four-day conference. At least three executive sessions were disrupted, one livestream had its audio briefly cut, and demonstrators also gathered outside the venue.In one such incident, Vaniya Agrawal – a former software engineer along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr shouted at the company’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.On May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh’s keynote presentation, shouting: “Jay! My people are suffering”.Last week, Microsoft acknowledged supplying AI services to the Israeli military but stated itfound no evidence that its Azure cloud or AI tools were used to directly target or harm civilians in Gaza. However, internal dissent continues. The employee-led group claims the company has blocked internal emails containing terms like “Palestine” and “Gaza.”Microsoft has previously dismissed employees who protested its involvement in Israel, including during its 50th anniversary celebration in April.","Fired Microsoft employee sent email to colleagues challenging the company's statements about the use of its Azure cloud services in Gaza.

From praise to silence, Aaron Rodgers questions where stars stand now

During his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers didn't mince words when the topic shifted to celebrity involvement in Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ now-infamous party scene. As legal allegations mount against the music mogul, Rodgers called out the eerie silence from celebrities who once proudly attended these events. His pointed remarks challenged the selective morality of Hollywood's elite.Amid the growing scandal surrounding Sean “Diddy” Combs, Aaron Rodgers is speaking out. In a bold conversation on The Joe Rogan Experience, the NFL star called out celebrities by name for their past praise of Diddy’s parties and their current silence as serious allegations surface.“You know, how many guys were on video saying, 'Ain’t no party like a Diddy party.' How many people openly talked about being there? [LeBron]. Yeah, how Ashton Kutcher and all these people, like you guys all went and you didn’t see nothing?” Rodgers told Rogan, making it clear he was unimpressed by the lack of accountability from those once closely associated with Diddy.Rodgers didn’t stop there. He went on to comment about the power dynamics that may be keeping people quiet, “I think there are so many f*cking powerful people that are on those lists.There's so many powerful people that went and [gesturing air quotes] partied.”His frustration centered not on implicating specific individuals in wrongdoing, but on the broader unwillingness of influential figures to speak up now that serious allegations have surfaced. For Rodgers, this isn't just about Diddy, it's about a culture of complicity in the entertainment world, where being in the inner circle often means turning a blind eye.Also read: Tom Brady goes big in Las Vegas with groundbreaking sports history experience The conversation touched a nerve, especially as figures like LeBron James , once seen praising Diddy’s parties, have remained silent.

Jenn Sterger reveals how old voicemails and Sidekick T-mail played a crucial role

The Fall Of Brett Favre - Jenn Sterger | EP. 113

Jenn Sterger’s career suffered while Brett Favre walked away with a fine

More than a decade after the scandal first made headlines, former Jets sideline reporter Jenn Sterger has reignited the conversation around Brett Favre’s alleged misconduct. In a candid interview on the George Janko Show, Sterger revisited the controversial 2008 incident—revealing how the outdated technology of that era helped verify her claims and further exposing the flaws in how the NFL handled the situation.During the conversation, Sterger offered a deeper dive into the evidence she received back in 2008 while Favre was quarterbacking for the New York Jets. She stated she never met Favre in person but believes it was him based on the voicemails left on her phone.""I never met Brett Favre,"" she said. ""The only reason that I assume that it’s him is because of the voicemails.""She explained that the nature of early 2000s tech played an unexpected role in exposing the messages. With no deepfakes or voice-altering apps available back then, she believes the audio clips were genuine. The explicit photos, she noted, were sent via T-mail, a once-popular messaging feature on Sidekick phones.“Do you know what T-mail is?” she joked. “Which makes this story so much sadder. It’s like the T-mail, the Crocs... like, we can go so many directions with where this went wrong.”George Janko chimed in on the recklessness of the situation, calling out the lack of caution: “Very sloppy work.By the way—for you to be using emails so like no one knows who you are, and then throw a voicemail up is wildly dumb, bro.”The fallout for Sterger was significant. She’s spoken openly about how the scandal derailed her media career and how she felt abandoned by both the public and the NFL. Meanwhile, Favre, who was married at the time, reportedly admitted to the voicemails but denied sending any explicit content. The NFL fined him $50,000—not for misconduct, but for failing to fully cooperate with the investigation.Sterger’s latest revelations come on the heels of Netflix’s release of Untold: The Fall of Favre, a documentary that delves into both the sexting scandal and Favre’s alleged involvement in a Mississippi welfare fraud case.Also Read: Donald Trump mocks New York Jets in a subtle way, while praising Tim Tebow’s NFL success As new details emerge, it’s clear that this chapter of NFL history remains deeply unsettling—and unresolved.","Former Jets sideline reporter Jenn Sterger has reignited the conversation around Brett Favre's alleged misconduct.

The couple didn’t hold back on the PDA, with fans commenting that Cardi looked “happier than ever.”If the diss track wasn’t enough, Offset also took to social media with a now-deleted post that fans saw as another dig at Cardi.Dressed in all black and lighting a blunt, he captioned the photo: “Spend time with your kids, not just on the gram.” While Cardi has yet to publicly respond, the jab didn’t go unnoticed by fans, who saw it as a swipe at her parenting.As expected, fans took to Twitter and Instagram with reactions ranging from savage to supportive. One user joked, “Offset really went from Bad & Boujee to Petty & Personal,” while another added, “He can’t take that she moved on with higher self-esteem.” Another fan simply stated what many are thinking: “Athlete money on a whole other level, idk who Offset talking to like that.”Also Read: ""Soft and lame"": Eagles’ Saquon Barkley defends tush push with fierce words for the NFL critics With their divorce still in progress and two young children caught in the middle, it’s clear this breakup saga is far from over.

With Grand Theft Auto VI officially on tap for a 2026 launch, gamers are abuzz not only about the core story but also what Rockstar is doing with the online experience. Though details have remained under wraps, a consistent flow of leaks and educated speculation has generated plenty of chatter. From a possible name change to free-to-play gameplay, here are eight rumors surrounding GTA Online 2 that, surprisingly, may not be so far off the mark.Several insiders think Rockstar won't do aat all. Rather, the online mode might simply be namedhinting at a new start, and a move away from the original's legacy constraints.Similar to how GTA Online ultimately diverged from GTA V, rumors indicate the next version might be released as a free, stand-alone title, making it even more accessible and widespread, particularly for those that simply want the online universe.The free-to-play business model has taken over in multiplayer gaming, and Rockstar can easily join in. This would enable GTA Online to compete more squarely withand, depending on in-game buying rather than initial sales.Cross-play between Xbox and PlayStation has long been the most highly requested feature. Leaks emphatically indicate GTA Online will be crossplay-enabled at launch, tearing down console community barriers.Rumors have it that GTA Online 2 comes out 1 to 3 months later than GTA VI, consistent with the release of GTA V. This allows Rockstar to fine-tune the experience, prevent crunch, and manage server load more effectively.In contrast to the static Los Santos of the earlier online world, this new iteration could follow a live-service approach where the map grows, with fresh cities, events, and narrative arcs being incorporated on a regular basis.There's a rumor of an in-depth role-playing system, where decisions, affiliations, and activities influence your reputation in the world, rather than the straightforward mission grinding.As Rockstar investigates AI technology in-house, others hope NPCs and missions within GTA Online 2 will respond dynamically to players, making the online experience more immersive and unpredictable.Also Read: Fan reimagines GTA 6 trailer's opening in LEGO using AI animation","GTA Online 2 won't actually be titled GTA Online 2, insiders say.

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2

Fans Respond With Sarcastic Fervor



Rockstar's Pursuit of Perfection



Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

A Glitch, Not a Dealbreaker

Rockstar Games' follow-up trailer to Grand Theft Auto VI was intended to add more depth to the hype with its action-packed explosion and a glimpse into the tumultuous romance of Jason and Lucia. And by and large, it succeeded until a single minute detail ignited the internet to an extent nobody had anticipated.At the 1:50 point in the trailer, audiences see Jason Duval performing a quintessential GTA drive-by. It's smooth, it's aggressive and it contains a lighting bug. Sharp-eyed Reddit user claims the muzzle flash from Jason's pistol lights up the car interior and surroundings before the gun is ever fired.In any other game, a pre-timed lighting cue would pass without notice. But with GTA 6 — a game that's taken ten years to develop and is being billed as a paragon of graphical accuracy perfection is what fans demand. And they've been scrutinizing with microscopic care.The trailer, while widely praised for its energetic imagery and narrative, is now under new criticism because of this glitch. Nevertheless, the fan base's response was anything.Rather than fanning outrage, the error became meme material.""Pre-order cancelled, that's it,"" joked one Redditor. Another added, ""Dude, light speed is faster than John Rockstar."" Sarcastic comments kept rolling in, mocking the perceived seriousness of the blunder with over-the-top disappointment.An user said, ""Don't believe I was hyped about this!” punctuating now-habitual overblows of reaction to small game glitches with tongue firmly in cheek.With the joking aside, Rockstar Games and parent Take-Two Interactive are still committed to creating an industry-leading experience.
