Digress tigress: Zeenat's diary of adventure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digress-tigress-zeenats-diary-of-adventure/articleshow/116577184.cms,"Hello, world! My name is Zeenat and I am a stripingly pretty three-year-old tigress (think of me as wild feline equivalent of an 18-year-old human). I was born in Tadoba-Andheri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. But life has bigger plans for me. They told me I am to be a pioneer, a bringer of fresh genes to Similipal Tiger Reserve in Odisha, a role meant to strengthen the tiger lineage. I was brought to Similipal on Nov 14, and I spent 10 days in a soft enclosure.Nov 24: The gates to my new wild home are finally opened at Chahala. Sure, the humans have their reasons for releasing me into the wild, hoping I will breed a strong generation of tigers. But honestly? I am not interested in playing the part yet. I slip through a gap in the fence and, just like that, I am off.Dec 9: Something in me purrs, ""Go further."" I listen. With moonlight as my guide, I cross over from Similipal into Jharkhand overnight, fording the Subarnarekha. When the sun rises, the humans seem puzzled. They track me through that little gadget they put around my neck - a radio collar - and realise I am no longer in Odisha. I wander 5km into Jharkhand's Chaibasa. It is not a difficult journey.Dec 10: The humans are nervous and track me with their devices, making sure they know exactly where I am. They send out alerts to authorities in Bengal, just in case I decide to make a run for it into their forests. They also reach out to Jharkhand's authorities. I hear their whispers in the wind, their worry travelling faster than my paws. But I am not interested in returning to Similipal. Not yet. For now, I stay put in Jharkhand.Dec 11: Oh, they're getting serious. The humans want to tranquillize me and bring me back to Similipal. A whole team armed with darts is sent to keep an eye on me. The idea of being knocked out doesn't sound appealing. I keep moving, covering distances at night, always staying a few steps ahead.Dec 15: I stay put for a bit in Rajabasa of Chakulia range (in Jharkhand). I take down some prey and need a rest. The humans monitor me closely, following every signal from my collar. They are relieved I haven't gone closer to villages or gotten too curious about human settlements.Dec 17: I start heading south, inching closer to Odisha. Kumki elephants are brought in, and the humans hope they will help guide me back. As if I am going to let them herd me like cattle. I am not playing along. I retreat deeper into the forests of Chakulia range. I become a shadow.Dec 18: The humans seem unsure whether to tranquillize me. I overhear them saying I am weak and haven't eaten since Saturday (Dec 14). Weak? Me? I smile inwardly at the irony. Tigers like me thrive on resilience. They hope to catch me in one of their darting operations, but every move they make, I counter with stealth.Dec 20: Surprise! I have crossed into Bengal's Jhargram forest. The humans are on edge. They are worried I might stray too close to densely populated areas. I am not planning to cause trouble. So, I move quietly, avoiding people and their villages. The landscape here is more challenging, more rugged, and I am loving it. I move swiftly.Dec 21: Belpahari range in Jhargram, a pit stop. The radio collar's signals are patchy, and I sense the humans' frustration. They can't seem to figure out where I will pop up next. The forests here are different, the prey scarce, and the human presence palpable. I don't linger.Dec 22: Here I am, deep in Purulia district's Bandwan, 50km from where I was last spotted. The humans are trying to get a lock on my position through the collar, but it is not easy when the land is tricky. I am careful, staying away from villages and focusing on wildlife around me. Will I return to Similipal? Perhaps. But for now, my adventure continues.","Three-year-old Zeenat was born in Tadoba-Andheri Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.

Brandon Joseph was arrested for driving under the influence and has since been released

Former Detroit Lions safety Brandon Joseph was arrested by the Dearborn Heights police department Saturday and has since been released, according to a spokesperson. Joseph was arrested for speeding and suspicion of operating under the influence, but was cooperative throughout the process. He was waived from the active roster on Saturday, and the spokesperson cannot confirm the reason for his arrest.Brandon Joseph, a second-year Lions safety, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. He was stopped on the road for speeding at 1:47 am and was taken into custody for a few hours. According to Dearborn Heights police, Joseph was traveling at speeds higher than the stipulated speed but not at excessive speeds.“He was very compliant, he was very respectful,” Paul Vanderplow, the Dearborn Heights Police Department director said referring to Joseph’s situation. “He went through the battery of tests, through those tests now we have some analysis to go through before charges can be done… He’ll go through that process, and then go through the court process like anybody else.”The Lions have not commented yet, but by moving on from Joseph, he will end up on the waiver wire. If no team puts in a claim in the likely scenario, the 23-year-old will become a free agent. Considering his legal situation, though, it would come as no surprise if Joseph were to remain on the market for an extended period. A 2023 UDFA, he appeared in only two games in his rookie season but did feature much more this year.Joseph was signed by the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent on May 12, 2023. He was waived on August 29, 2023 and re-signed to the practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 30, 2024. Joseph played in all 14 Lions games this season, contributing on special teams and taking over as a gunner after Khalil Dorsey's injury. He logged a 20% snap share on defense, contributing to a struggling Lions secondary. Joseph recorded 13 tackles and one pass deflection in 2024, despite numerous injuries.Also Read: Reports indicates that the Chiefs are considering claiming WR Diontae Johnson following the Ravens' termination of their contract The Lions added safety Loren Strickland to the active roster for Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears. Strickland is a second-year special teams player who has appeared in all 14 games this season and could take over Joseph's special teams roles going forward. He has taken some snaps on defense due to injuries within the secondary.","Brandon Joseph, a second-year Lions safety, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Caitlin Clark

“I noticed here that coaches here are giving her – not pushing her – but giving her some physicality.”

“That is something that a lot of people have also been talking about online with Caitlin Clark. It seems like she has already gotten a little bit bulkier since the end of the season,”

“Obviously she’s a one-of-a-kind basketball player, but the thing is, she’s not a one-of-a-kind person in the weight room. She has this very high skill set in basketball, but her physical development could really be improved.”

“I think it’s going to be very hard to guard her if she masters her touch at the basket. Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves,”

“Now I don’t know if that’s because she has been straight in the weight room getting her reps in or it’s the fact that she played an entire NBA season with college and her first WNBA season and she pretty much played like 40 minutes a game,”

“Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves.”

’s numerous achievement is mostly based on her performance on the court. It looks like her rise to stardom is back to where it belongs — on the basketball court. After months of attention centered on accolades like her TIME magazine honor and debates about her impact on the WNBA , the focus has returned to her game.The shift in Clark’s approach is clear. A recent training video shared by the Indiana Fever’s social media accounts showcased Clark practicing her skills while coaches incorporated more physicality into her drills. This approach is no accident. Analyst Rachel DeMita noted in her YouTube video,Physicality has become a key talking point for Caitlin Clark’s development, and it’s not just about what’s happening in practice. Fans and analysts alike have observed a noticeable change in her physique.DeMita remarked.This evolution in Clark’s approach isn’t new. During her senior year at Iowa, Clark gained 8 pounds and this was because her opponents were physically targeting her. Iowa’s associate strength and conditioning coach, Lindsay Alexander, reflected on her progress, saying,Clark’s offseason training isn’t limited to physical gains. Reports suggest she’s sharpening critical elements of her game, including ball handling, off-balance finishing, mid-range shots, screen navigation, and, of course, her long-distance three-pointers.DeMita emphasized that this enhanced version of Clark will be a nightmare for opposing defenses.she stated.There’s also speculation about the source of Clark’s bulkier frame. DeMita posed an interesting theory, suggesting that her grueling schedule since her senior year at Iowa — playing college basketball, Olympic games, and her first WNBA season — might have contributed to the change.she explained.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 The WNBA’s 12 teams and 144 players will have to adjust to Caitlin Clark’s new training and transformation.

Hilary Stewart Blazevic, a passenger, told Storyful that a woman alerted a flight attendant about the leak after using the restroom. The crew failed to stop the leakage despite their best efforts.“It was utter disbelief and a little panic,” Blazevic recounted, explaining how passengers scrambled to lift their feet and belongings out of the “disgusting” water pooling on the floor.A viral TikTok video, which has now garnered over 7.2 million views, captured the chaos onboard.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google proposes a fix for the break up order 'thrown at it',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-proposes-a-fix-for-the-break-up-order-thrown-at-it/articleshow/116559970.cms,"Google’s proposal to the US government

“Browser agreements:

Browser companies like Apple and Mozilla should continue to have the freedom to do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users. The Court accepted that browser companies “occasionally assess Google’s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google’s to be superior.” And for companies like Mozilla, these contracts generate vital revenue.

Our proposal allows browsers to continue to offer Google Search to their users and earn revenue from that partnership. But it also provides them with additional flexibility: It would allow for multiple default agreements across different platforms (e.g., a different default search engine for iPhones and iPads) and browsing modes, plus the ability to change their default search provider at least every 12 months (the court’s decision specifically referred to a 12 month agreement as “presumed reasonable” under antitrust law).

Android contracts:

Our proposal means device makers have additional flexibility in preloading multiple search engines, and preloading any Google app independently of preloading Search or Chrome. Again, this will give our partners additional flexibility and our rivals like Microsoft more chances to bid for placement.

Oversight and compliance:

Our proposal includes a robust mechanism to ensure we comply with the Court’s order without giving the Government extensive power over the design of your online experience.”

Google has proposed offering more options to other companies that sign contracts with it to be the automatic search engine. In a blog post, the company has proposed remedies that will offer more choices for consumers when browsing the web or using Android smartphones to assure that the US federal judge won’t need not do much to fix its search monopoly.. The proposal comes after a federal judge found Google guilty of antitrust violations earlier this year. Last month, the US government also suggested forcing Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular web browser.Google, on the other hand, has suggested less restrictive measures, such as allowing more flexibility in exclusive agreements and offering consumers more choice in search engines on Android devices and web browsers. US Judge Amit P. Mehta is expected to decide on the appropriate remedy by next year and his ruling could significantly impact the internet landscape.In the blog post, Google noted its proposal for remedies to end its search monopoly.

Spangram for today

Today's Strands’ answers:

The first word is sleigh.

The second word is walking.

The third word is bells.

The fourth word is glistening.

The fifth word is snow.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles.

Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

NFL streaming schedule on Netflix

What make NFL streaming on Netflix BIG

Netflix is reportedly pulling out all the stops for its two Christmas Day NFL games, including a pre-game performance by Mariah Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" According to a report by news agency AP, however, there is anxiety. For, the steaming giant recognizes that technical difficulties could ruin the experience. As Netflix executive Brandon Riegg, VP of nonfiction series and sports, told AP, that the memory of the streaming issues encountered during the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight on November 14 is mit fresh.Riegg, while addressing the concerns about Netflix's readiness for a potentially record-breaking viewership, added with a caution that the sheer volume of viewers for the fight overwhelmed the system, despite extensive pre-event testing. While acknowledging the issues experienced by some viewers, Riegg emphasized that the event served as a crucial stress test, leading to numerous system improvements.""The sheer tonnage of people that came to watch was incredible. And for all the testing that the engineering team had done ahead of that, and I think they’re the best in the business, the only way to test something of that magnitude is to have something of that magnitude,” Riegg said. “We never want to have technical issues or a disappointing experience for our members. There was a subset of people that were watching that struggled with that and we acknowledge that. The good news is they stress-tested the system to such a degree that there’s a lot of these fixes and improvements that they realized that they could make, and they’re applying all that stuff.”Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show starting at 11 a.m. EST, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. EST. These games will be available to Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries, marking the first global distribution of an NFL game by a single outlet. This marks the first year of a three-year deal, with Netflix also streaming one game each in 2025 and 2026, at a cost of $150 million for this year's package. While a full season package doesn't align with Netflix's strategy, the Christmas Day games presented a unique opportunity.This move signals Netflix's broader ambition to become a major destination for sports fans, evidenced by its recent acquisition of U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup and its upcoming partnership with WWE, beginning January 6th with ""Monday Night Raw.""The Tyson-Paul fight drew a global audience of 60 million, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams (38 million in the U.S.). However, Down Detector reported nearly 85,000 viewer complaints of outages and streaming problems leading up to the fight. This contrasts with previous benchmarks for streamed NFL games: 23 million viewers on Peacock for last season's AFC wild card game and 17.3 million on Amazon Prime Video for a regular-season game.The NFL's decision to schedule games on Christmas, despite it falling on a Wednesday, is reportedly driven by the potential for increased viewership. Last year's three Christmas games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The league approved two Christmas games in March, prompting Netflix's interest. Their existing relationship with the NFL through series like ""Quarterback"" and ""Receiver"" facilitated the deal.","Netflix will stream two games on Christmas Day: the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Kansas City Chiefs, preceded by a two-hour pregame show.
