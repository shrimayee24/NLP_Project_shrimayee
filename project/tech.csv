"Bengaluru Robbery: Gold, diamond, cash gone,, Man robs Bengaluru professor’s house; leaves tap on to flood home, erase footprints, mislead sniffer dogs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-leaves-tap-open-to-erase-trace-before-fleeing-with-rs-30l-from-profs-house/articleshow/122958451.cms,"



BENGALURU: A miscreant broke into the locked home of a college professor in Nagarabhavi 2nd Stage and escaped with gold, diamond jewellery, and cash worth over Rs 30 lakh. In a bid to cover his tracks, he turned on a kitchen tap before fleeing, flooding the house in a bid to destroy his footprints and mislead the sniffer dogs.The victim, Chandana (name changed), had left her home on July 20 to stay at her parents' house in Mallathahalli while her husband was abroad. She ensured multiple safety measures were in place — she had secured the house with metal grills over doors, installed CCTV cameras, and even suspended daily deliveries like milk and newspapers — to ensure the house does not attract the attention of thieves.She also asked her domestic helper of four years to visit the house every morning to water the plants and clean the front yard. The helper, however, did not have access to the locked house, police said.On Saturday morning, the helper noticed the front door ajar and immediately alerted Chandana. Inside, the hall and kitchen were flooded with water, with a tap left running in an apparent attempt by the burglar to erase any evidence.Following the alert, Chandana rushed back to discover the iron grill gate had been forcefully broken, followed by the main wooden door.The bedroom upstairs was ransacked, with almirahs and cupboards broken open and valuables missing.The stolen items included necklaces, bangles, chains, earrings, rings, pendants, gold coins, and Rs 18,000 in cash. According to a police officer, the break-in appeared to be the work of a single individual who spent nearly two hours inside the house before fleeing.Annapoorneshwarinagar police, along with the Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) team, have intensified investigation.","A miscreant broke into the locked home of a college professor in Nagarabhavi 2nd Stage and escaped with gold, diamond jewellery, and cash worth over Rs 30 lakh.

Apple working on its foldable iPhone



In an awkward slip-up, Apple ’s official support account on Chinese social media platform — Weibo , accidentally posted a promotional video for Samsung’s recently launched Galaxy Z Flip 7 smartphone. The smartphone is said to be a direct competition to Apple’s rumoured foldable iPhone . The embarrassing incident, which saw a video for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 appear on an Apple-branded channel, has since been rectified, with the video promptly taken down. As reported by 9to5Mac, the post on Apple’s support account was originally created to highlight Apple’s parental control features for App Store downloads. However, instead of embedding an Apple-branded video, the account accidentally included a clip showcasing Samsung’s latest foldable smartphone .As reported by 9to5Mac, the blunder happened when Apple’s support account was promoting the parental controls the company offer for App Store downloads. Instead of adding the Apple related video, the post accidentally carried a commercial for the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.While the reason for the mixup is not known right now but two primary theories are circulating. The most probable explanation suggests a simple copy-paste error, where the individual managing the account may have intended to embed an Apple video but still had a link to the Samsung promotion in their paste buffer. Another possibility raised is that the account is managed by a local marketing agency in China that handles campaigns for both Apple and Samsung.Apple is said to be working on its own foldable device. The Cupertino-based tech giant is expected to launch its first foldable iPhone in the second half of next year, according to JP Morgan. In a note to clients (via CNBC), JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said “With the upgrades to the iPhone 17 series to be released this fall expected to be fairly limited, investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026”, The note further stated that Apple foldable iPhone may feature a book-style fold similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series.","Apple ’s official support account on Chinese social media platform — Weibo accidentally posted a promotional video for Samsung’s recently launched Galaxy Z Flip 7 smartphone.

ViewSonic VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 review: 240Hz without breaking the bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/viewsonic-vx2758a-2k-pro-3-review-240hz-without-breaking-the-bank/articleshow/123010457.cms,"Function over form

Speed meets reality

Doing double duty

The reality check

The ViewSonic VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 sits in that sweet spot where ambitious specs meet reasonable pricing. At around ₹21,000, it promises 27-inch 2K gaming at 240Hz, numbers that would have cost twice as much just a couple of years ago. But beyond the impressive spec sheet lies a monitor that's refreshingly honest about what it delivers.The VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 won't win any design awards, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. ViewSonic has gone for a no-nonsense approach with matte black plastic construction and slim bezels that fade into the background. There's no RGB lighting or aggressive gaming aesthetics here, just a monitor that does its job without demanding attention.The build quality feels solid enough for the price point. The metal base provides decent stability, though you'll notice some wobble if you're an enthusiastic desk-thumper. The chassis itself doesn't creak or flex, which is more than you can say for some budget displays.Here's where reality sets in: the included stand only tilts. No height adjustment, no swivel, no rotation. If you're not sitting at the perfect height or prefer portrait orientation for coding, you'll need to budget extra for a VESA arm. It's a practical limitation that keeps costs down, but one that might catch some buyers off guard.The connectivity is refreshingly straightforward, two HDMI 2.1 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4. No USB hub, no built-in speakers, no unnecessary bells and whistles. For most gaming setups involving a PC and console, this covers the basics without cable clutter.The 27-inch SuperClear IPS panel is where this monitor starts to shine. The 2560×1440 resolution hits the sweet spot for modern gaming, sharp enough to appreciate detail without demanding flagship GPU horsepower. Colors pop with that characteristic IPS vibrancy, and viewing angles remain consistent even when you're gaming from the couch.The 240Hz refresh rate is the star of the show, though with some caveats. When your hardware can push those frame rates, the difference from 144Hz is noticeable, not revolutionary, but definitely smoother. Fast-paced shooters like Valorant and CS2 feel more responsive, with reduced motion blur during quick camera movements.AMD FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatibility work as advertised, eliminating screen tearing across a wide refresh range. The 1ms MPRT response time keeps ghosting to a minimum, though enabling this mode dims the display noticeably and disables HDR.Speaking of HDR, let's manage expectations. With a peak brightness of around 300 nits, HDR10 support feels more like a checkbox feature than a genuine enhancement. Colors become oversaturated rather than truly dynamic, and bright scenes lose their punch. You're better off sticking to SDR for consistent image quality.Color accuracy is decent out of the box but not exceptional. Professional work requiring precise colors will need calibration, though casual content creation and gaming look perfectly fine. The sRGB mode covers the full gamut but runs dimmer than ideal for daytime use.While marketed primarily for gaming, the VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 handles other tasks reasonably well. Movie watching benefits from the wide viewing angles and solid contrast, though the modest brightness means HDR content won't deliver the intended impact. The anti-glare coating helps in bright rooms but introduces a subtle grainy texture that becomes noticeable with pure white backgrounds.For productivity work, the 27-inch 2K resolution provides ample screen real estate. Text remains sharp, and color-sensitive tasks like photo editing are manageable with some tweaking. The lack of height adjustment becomes more apparent during long work sessions, where ergonomics matter more than in gaming scenarios.The blue light filter and flicker-free technology genuinely help during extended use. Eye strain feels reduced compared to cheaper panels, making this monitor viable for both work and play without constant mode switching.Content consumption falls somewhere in the middle. Streaming services look crisp and colorful, though the limited brightness means darker scenes can feel washed out in bright rooms. The wide color gamut helps animated content and games pop, but live-action HDR material doesn't quite reach its potential.The ViewSonic VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 succeeds by being honest about its priorities. It's a gaming monitor first, with other uses being pleasant bonuses rather than primary strengths. The 240Hz performance is genuine and smooth when your hardware can deliver, making competitive gaming feel notably more responsive.The compromises are clear but reasonable. The basic stand limits positioning options, HDR performance underwhelms, and color accuracy requires tweaking for professional work. But these aren't deal-breakers, they're conscious trade-offs that keep the price accessible.For competitive gamers upgrading from 60Hz or 1080p displays, the improvement will feel transformative. The combination of higher resolution and refresh rate creates a notably more immersive experience. Casual users will appreciate the crisp visuals and smooth motion, even if they never approach 240fps.This monitor delivers exactly what it promises, high refresh rate 2K gaming at for Rs 20,000. The limitations are present but predictable, making it an easy recommendation for anyone prioritising performance over premium features.","The ViewSonic VX2758A-2K-PRO-3 has a 27-inch SuperClear IPS panel.

'We must confront them': British woman slammed for criticising Hindi-speaking staff at Heathrow; accused of racism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/we-must-confront-them-british-woman-slammed-for-criticising-hindi-speaking-staff-at-heathrow-accused-of-racism/articleshow/122933874.cms,"(Image: X @LucyJayneWhite1)





A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

The GCC Unified Tourist Visa: What’s Coming Next?





Which Oman Visa Option Works Best for You?

If you’re from one of the 100+ visa-free countries (like the US, UK, Germany, Australia, or Japan), the 14-day visa-free entry is the easiest choice. Just make sure you meet the basic requirements and keep your stay under two weeks.

If your country isn’t on the visa-free list but you hold a valid visa or residency from trusted countries (US, UK, Schengen, Canada, Australia, Japan, or GCC), you can still enter Oman visa-free for 14 days.

If neither applies or you want to stay longer than 14 days, the eVisa is your best option. It’s straightforward and you can apply online from anywhere.

If you plan to visit multiple Gulf countries in the future, watch for the GCC Unified Tourist Visa launching late 2025 or early 2026. Until then, stick with Oman’s current visa rules.

Is vaping illegal in UAE? What visitors and residents need to know to avoid fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/is-vaping-illegal-in-uae-what-visitors-and-residents-need-to-know-to-avoid-fines/articleshow/122989827.cms,"E-cigarettes are legal in Dubai, but using them in the wrong place can lead to heavy fines/ Representative Image

TL;DR

E-cigarettes (vapes) are legal to own and use in Dubai, but only in certain places.

You can’t use them indoors or in most public spaces.

Fines range from AED 500 to AED 2,000 for breaking the rules.

The Law Around E-Cigarettes in Dubai

Restaurants

Malls

Offices

Airports (outside of smoking lounges)

Government buildings

Beaches and parks

What About Tourists Carrying E-Cigarettes?

You must be over 18 to carry or buy them.

Items should be stored safely, preferably in checked baggage.

E-liquid must follow airline rules: no more than 100 ml per container, sealed in a clear plastic bag.

Penalties If You Break the Rules

What You Can and Can’t Do

Know the law. Regulations can change, so check the latest rules before using or carrying e-cigarettes around the city. Stick to smoking zones. Only use e-cigarettes in areas where smoking is clearly allowed. These are often marked and found in some outdoor public spaces. Never use them indoors. That includes malls, restaurants, offices, taxis, and enclosed public places. Even if no one stops you, it's still illegal. Respect cultural norms. Dubai is diverse, and public behavior matters. Be mindful of how using e-cigarettes might come across to others, especially in family spaces. Ask if you’re not sure. When in a hotel, café, or private space, ask staff if e-cigarette use is allowed before using your device. Dispose of waste properly. Don’t leave used cartridges, packaging, or devices behind. Use bins—littering can lead to fines. Follow the house rules. Private businesses may have their own policies. Even if the city allows it, a venue might not. Keep yourself updated. Laws can shift. Stay informed, especially if you're a frequent traveler or plan to stay in the UAE long term.

Health Concerns





If you’re visiting Dubai, or living there, you’ve probably noticed how clean and well-organized public spaces are. The city takes rules seriously. That includes how it handles smoking and vaping.While you might see someone using an e-cigarette (also called a vape), outside a mall or on a sidewalk, that doesn’t mean it’s allowed. Dubai has clear rules on where you can vape, what kind of products are legal, and who can use them. These rules are part of a broader effort to protect public health and respect social norms.So if you’re traveling with a vape or thinking about using one in public, it’s important to understand how the laws work. The last thing you want is to face a fine, or worse, because you didn’t know the local rules.Let’s break it down clearly.The UAE officially legalized the sale and use of e-cigarettes in 2019. That made it legal for licensed shops to sell devices, refills, and accessories, as long as they meet local standards. But legalization didn’t make them welcome everywhere.Dubai restricts where e-cigarettes can be used. Just like with traditional cigarettes, you can't use them in enclosed or public indoor spaces. That includes:If you’re in a shared public space, chances are it’s a no-go zone for e-cigarette use unless there's a designated smoking area.Tourists can bring e-cigarettes into Dubai for personal use. That includes disposable devices, liquids, and chargers. But there are a few things to keep in mind:Dubai customs may inspect your bags. If something looks suspicious or exceeds limits, it could be confiscated. Bringing small, clearly personal-use quantities is usually fine.Fines for using e-cigarettes in the wrong places in Dubai can be quite steep. If you’re caught, you may have to pay anywhere from AED 500 (about $135) up to AED 2,000 (around $545). Repeat offenses can lead to even higher fines or possible legal action. There’s usually no warning, as enforcement is strict, especially in places like shopping malls, airports, and metro stations where surveillance is common.If you're using e-cigarettes (vapes) in Dubai, here are a few key things to keep in mind to avoid issues:The rules around e-cigarettes in Dubai are strict mainly because of health concerns. Authorities across the UAE worry about the long-term risks of nicotine products, including those found in e-cigarette liquids. Issues like high levels of nicotine salts, chemical additives in flavored liquids, and the risk of minors misusing these products all play a part. On top of that, there’s a strong public effort to discourage smoking and nicotine use overall. That’s why you’ll often see awareness campaigns aimed at quitting completely, not just switching from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes.","E-cigarettes are legal to own and use in Dubai, but only in certain places.

What is Leqembi?

Headaches





Reactions related to the infusion process





Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a term that refers to unusual changes detected in brain MRI scans. These abnormalities may include swelling (cerebral edema) or tiny brain bleeds (microhemorrhages).





Safety First: The Need for Careful Patient Monitoring



Advancing Healthcare with Biotechnology in Saudi Arabia



About the SFDA







The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) announced today the official approval of Leqembi, the first Alzheimer’s treatment available in Saudi Arabia. This approval marks a significant milestone in addressing Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills. Leqembi is specifically indicated for patients experiencing mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer’s, who have either no copies or just one copy of a particular gene variant known as apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).Leqembi represents an innovative approach to treating Alzheimer’s. Unlike many existing therapies that only ease symptoms, this drug aims to slow the actual progression of the disease. It is a biologic therapy developed using monoclonal antibody technology, a sophisticated method that creates lab-produced molecules designed to target specific proteins in the body.In this case, Leqembi works by targeting beta-amyloid proteins, which build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and form sticky clumps known as amyloid plaques. These abnormal protein fragments are widely believed to interfere with communication between brain cells, contributing to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.These plaques interfere with the normal communication between nerve cells (neurons), disrupting brain function. By helping reduce the formation of these harmful plaques, Leqembi seeks to protect brain function and slow cognitive decline over time.The treatment is given through an intravenous infusion every two weeks, allowing the drug to circulate and act within the brain.As per the report, before approving Leqembi, the SFDA thoroughly reviewed evidence of its safety, effectiveness, quality, and compliance with regulatory standards. Clinical trials revealed that Leqembi significantly slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease compared to a placebo. The effectiveness was measured using established clinical scales that assess memory, thinking, and daily functioning abilities.However, like all medications, Leqembi can cause side effects. The most commonly reported include:Because ARIA can only be detected through brain scans, careful monitoring is essential throughout treatment.The SFDA stresses the importance of ongoing patient monitoring during treatment. Before starting Leqembi, patients must be tested for their ApoE4 gene status, as this influences the risk of side effects. Those with two copies of the ApoE4 gene are not currently eligible for the treatment due to a higher likelihood of complications.Additionally, the pharmaceutical company responsible for Leqembi is required to track how the drug performs once it is in use (post-marketing surveillance). They must regularly submit updated reports on safety and effectiveness to the SFDA. A comprehensive risk management plan is also mandatory to ensure the treatment is used safely and responsibly.The approval of Leqembi reflects the SFDA’s commitment to expanding access to advanced and high-quality medical treatments, especially those developed through cutting-edge biotechnological methods. Biotech therapies like Leqembi represent a rapidly growing field in medicine, offering new hope for diseases that previously had limited treatment options.Established in 2003 under the Council of Ministers’ resolution, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority is an independent regulatory body directly reporting to the President of the Council of Ministers. Its main mission is to safeguard public health by ensuring the safety and quality of food, medicines, biological and chemical substances, medical devices, and cosmetics. The SFDA oversees all procedures related to these products, aiming to protect both human and animal health throughout the Kingdom.","Leqembi targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, aiming to slow Alzheimer’s progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

With the new Umrah season starting in 2025, Saudi authorities are making clear that the focus is not just on numbers, but on the people behind them. The aim this year is simple: make the pilgrimage safer, easier, and more spiritually fulfilling. While millions are expected to visit the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, the Kingdom is working to remove the usual stress points, whether it’s confusion at busy mosques, difficulty for elderly visitors, or problems with hotel bookings.Instead of big slogans or ambitious promises, this year’s changes are grounded in real action. From helpful digital tools to safety gear for vulnerable groups, Saudi Arabia is pushing practical solutions. And with tighter inspections on tourist services, there's also a clear message: quality and safety matter more than ever.These new moves show how the Kingdom is managing modern challenges without losing sight of the spiritual heart of Umrah.One of the main upgrades this year is digital, and very hands-on. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has rolled out a campaign in Madinah to promote the ""Rushd"" app, designed specifically for pilgrims.What the app offers:The campaign is being run at key visitor areas around the Prophet’s Mosque, including historic locations. It’s not just about downloading an app, it’s about helping people use it in a meaningful way while they’re on their journey.To support vulnerable pilgrims, like children, the elderly, and visually impaired visitors, the General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque has launched smart safety bracelets.Here’s what they do:This isn’t about surveillance. It’s about safety, especially in a setting where it's easy to get separated or overwhelmed.A lot of what makes or breaks a pilgrim’s experience is behind the scenes: how smooth the transport is, how well the crowd is managed, or how clean and accessible public areas are. To that end, 16 new initiatives have been rolled out in Madinah under the Pilgrim Experience Program.What’s being improved:In total, 89 different projects across 23 government agencies are currently active, covering everything from security and tourism to health and logistics. According to officials, 95% of these projects are already completed or in final stages.Pilgrims shouldn’t have to worry about where they’re staying, especially in a city as sacred as Makkah. That’s why the Ministry of Tourism has stepped up inspections and closed 25 non-compliant facilities just this July.The reasons included:This crackdown is part of the wider ""Our Guests Come First"" campaign, which also encourages pilgrims to report issues through the Unified Tourism Center (dial 930).It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in a huge place like the Prophet’s Mosque, especially if you're a first-timer or don’t speak Arabic. That’s why two service centers within the mosque courtyards have played a key role in helping pilgrims feel supported.In 2024 alone, these centers:These centers focus on what matters most, comfort, clarity, and calm during worship.Rushd is a free mobile app launched by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.

Staying Compliant with Labour Laws





If your business in Dubai needs to operate outside regular hours, say, late at night or early morning, there’s something important you should know. Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.But not every business needs it. This permit is for specific types of work that take place after-hours inside commercial buildings, shopping malls, or banks. Think maintenance crews fixing lighting, staff doing inventory checks in retail stores, or film crews shooting scenes in a mall at night. It’s not for late-night shopping or customer-facing services.So why is this permit required? Mostly for safety, accountability, and legal compliance. After dark, closed spaces often have heightened security protocols. Workers moving around during these hours can trigger alarms or raise suspicion. This permit ensures everyone, employers, employees, property owners, and law enforcement, is on the same page. It’s also part of protecting the welfare of workers who are active during non-standard hours.This permit is meant for businesses or contractors doing non-commercial work after hours.

That includes protecting workers from burnout, setting boundaries on late-night shifts, and ensuring people aren’t forced to work in unsafe conditions.If you run a business that regularly needs to operate outside normal hours, staying on top of this permit process is a good way to avoid penalties, and show that you’re running your operations responsibly.","Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.

Watch Sydney Sweeney Ad About ""Jeans"" and ""Genes"" Getting Insane Blowback From the Left, with VDH





TV host Megyn Kelly slammed critics on Monday who accused actress Sydney Sweeney ’s new American Eagle ad of promoting white supremacy, calling the controversy “absurd” and blaming the “lunatic left” for creating outrage.Speaking on her podcast,, the host said Sweeney is being unfairly labeled a white supremacist over her role in American Eagle’s new denim campaign.“She’s being called a white supremacist by people who don’t like her latest ad, which is for American Eagle,” Kelly said.“She’s advertising jeans, and yet the lunatics on the left think she’s advertising white supremacy. This is obviously a reference to her body and not to her skin color, but the lunatic left is going to do what the lunatic left is going to do,"" she added.The controversy began after Sydney Sweeney appeared in an American Eagle ad where she jokes about having ""great jeans""—a play on the word ""genes.""The 27-year-old Euphoria star is seen in a classic Americana setting, fixing a car and driving while wearing the brand’s denim.The tagline reads: “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.” The campaign plays on the word “genes,” as Sweeney herself is seen in a video replacing the word “genes” with “jeans” using red paint.In a voiceover, Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.”The ad quickly went viral, but not just for its style. Some critics have called it tone-deaf and accused it of promoting whiteness, thinness, and even eugenic ideology.Megyn went on to say that critics are upset over who was chosen to represent “America’s Best Genes.”She argued that people are “upset because it’s about who gets to be the face of America’s Best Genes. They think it’s no accident that they’ve chosen a white, thin woman because you’re, I guess, not allowed to celebrate those things in any way, shape, or form. But they’re completely ignoring the reference to her body, which is the thing she’s famous for. It’s just absurd.”The backlash stems from the phrase “great genes,” which critics say carries historical links to white supremacist and eugenic ideas.A widely circulated Salon article and viral social media posts claim that phrases like “great genes,” when paired with a blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman like Sweeney, echo historic white supremacist rhetoric and Nazi propaganda.One TikTok user commented, “A blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman talking about her good genes? That’s Nazi propaganda.”Some also took issue with the part of the ad where Sweeney paints over the word “genes” with “jeans.”They say it feels like an attempt to dismiss or joke about the deeper meaning, while still visually promoting ideas of genetic superiority.","The controversy began after Sydney Sweeney appeared in an American Eagle ad where she jokes about having ""great jeans"" The ad quickly went viral, but not just for its style.

FAQs



Q: What’s wrong with the phrase “great genes”?

Q: Was this ad intentionally fascist?

Q: Why hasn’t the ad been pulled?

Q: Is Sydney Sweeney responsible?

Bottom line:







Godwin's law states that any internet discussion will always veer towards someone making a comparison with Nazi or Hitler. And now that 4chan/Reddit ailment has escaped into the real world.A denim ad meant to celebrate American style has instead ignited a firestorm online, with critics accusing American Eagle and actress Sydney Sweeney of peddling ""Nazi fascist"" propaganda through a campaign that plays on the phrase “great genes”—a pun some say dangerously echoes eugenic and white supremacist ideals.The ad, part of American Eagle’s new denim campaign, features 27-year-old Euphoria actress Sydney Sweeney in a distinctly Americana setting—fixing her car, slipping into the driver’s seat, all while sporting a pair of jeans.The tagline reads: “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.” A follow-up video posted to American Eagle’s Instagram shows Sweeney approaching a billboard with the phrase “great genes.” She strikes out the word “genes” with red paint and replaces it with “jeans.”A cheeky wordplay, right? Not according to a growing number of online critics.he criticism stems from the historical baggage tied to the phrase “great genes.”According to a widely circulated Salon article, the expression has long been associated with white supremacist ideals—used to promote whiteness, thinness, and eurocentric beauty standards.The problem, critics argue, is that when the phrase is paired with Sweeney—a blue-eyed, blonde-haired woman often labelled the embodiment of “classic American beauty”—it begins to resemble eugenic messaging.“A blonde haired blue eyed white woman is talking about her good genes—that is Nazi propaganda,” said one viral TikTok user. The visual of Sweeney crossing out “genes” and writing “jeans” has also been read as symbolic—an attempt to deflect or mock the implications of genetic superiority while simultaneously reinforcing them.Social media backlash has been fierce and fast:“The Sydney Sweeney American Eagle jeans ad is NAZI propaganda, and you’re a fascist if you don’t agree.”“They could’ve gotten a beautiful Black woman to do this ad, but they picked a yt [white] woman instead…”“American Eagle needs to delete those Sydney Sweeney ads. They are genuinely scary.”Several creators have posted explainers breaking down the “dog whistles” embedded in the ad, referencing how similar language was used in Nazi Germany and, more recently, in far-right political circles to celebrate white dominance.That’s the cultural debate now unfolding.On one hand, the campaign is clearly playing on a pun—“genes” and “jeans.” On the other, when those words are paired with an image of a conventionally white American beauty and a brand literally called American Eagle, the symbolism feels more loaded than cheeky.Whether or not the messaging was intentional, critics argue that intent doesn't negate impact—especially when mass-market fashion ads operate in an ecosystem shaped by decades of race, class, and beauty privilege.Have American Eagle or Sydney Sweeney responded?No.As of July 28, 2025, neither the actress nor the brand has issued a public statement addressing the controversy.American Eagle’s Instagram post remains live, though comments appear to be limited or heavily moderated.Ironically, while the backlash raged online, the campaign did boost business. According to reports, American Eagle saw a 4% spike in shares after the ad dropped. But social goodwill may have taken a hit. Gen Z and millennial consumers—core demographics for American Eagle—have increasingly shown a preference for socially conscious branding, and this incident could create longer-term reputational risks.This isn’t the first time the actress has found herself in political hot water. Sweeney previously drew criticism in 2022 when photos surfaced from her mother’s 60th birthday party, where guests were seen in red hats that looked like MAGA caps. The hats actually read “Make Sixty Great Again,” a pun on her mother’s milestone birthday, but many on the internet interpreted it as a pro-Trump statement. The actress denied any political affiliations at the time, saying the celebration was not intended to be political, but the incident left the internet keeping a close eye on her public image. In this case, it’s less about what Sweeney has said and more about what her image represents in the broader cultural landscape.A: It has historical ties to eugenics and white supremacy, especially when used to describe blonde, blue-eyed, Eurocentric beauty as inherently superior.A: That’s debatable. There’s no proof of intent—but critics argue that the visual and verbal cues, even if unintentional, mirror fascist aesthetics and ideas.A: American Eagle has yet to respond. The company may be weighing whether the controversy helps or hurts brand visibility in the long run.A: That depends on how much creative input she had. While she starred in the ad, the brand and agency are ultimately responsible for messaging and design.In the age of internet hyper-literacy, ads don’t live in a vacuum. Whether by accident or design, this campaign has stirred up a hornet’s nest about race, beauty, and nationalism—and no one involved seems ready to put out the fire.","A denim ad meant to celebrate American style has ignited a firestorm online, with critics accusing American Eagle and actress Sydney Sweeney of peddling ""Nazi fascist"" propaganda.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Google DeepMind launches AI model that works like ‘virtual satellite’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-launches-ai-model-that-works-like-virtual-satellite/articleshow/123003052.cms,"How AlphaEarth Foundations AI model works



Google DeepMind , Google’s AI unit, has introduced an AI model, AlphaEarth Foundations , that integrates a massive cache of Earth observation data and generates a data representation that can help scientists and researchers understand and monitor our planet. The company says that the newest AI model functions like a “virtual satellite,” to provide insights into global changes.According to Google DeepMind, the model accurately and efficiently characterises the planet’s entire terrestrial land and coastal waters by integrating huge amounts of Earth observation data into a unified digital representation, or ""embedding,"" that computer systems can easily process.This allows the model to provide scientists with a more complete and consistent picture of our planet's evolution.According to the company, the data has been taken by satellites that capture information-rich images and measurements, providing scientists and experts with a nearly real-time view of our planet. The data is impactful, however, its complexity, multimodality and refresh rate creates a new challenge of connecting different datasets and making use of them all effectively.The AI model visualises the rich details of the world by assigning the colours red, green and blue to three of the 64 dimensions. For instance, in Ecuador, AlphaEarth Foundations can “see through persistent cloud cover” to detail agricultural plots. In Antarctica, it maps complex surfaces in clear detail, an area notoriously difficult for irregular satellite imaging. It can even reveal variations in Canadian agricultural land use that are invisible to the naked eye. Google says it tested AlphaEarth Foundations, consistently finding it to be the most accurate when compared against traditional methods and other AI mapping systems.To accelerate research and unlock use cases, Google is releasing a collection of AlphaEarth Foundations’ annual embeddings as the Satellite Embedding dataset in Google Earth Engine . The company is currently using the model to generate annual embeddings and believes its utility could be further amplified by combining it with general reasoning LLM agents like Gemini in the future.","Google DeepMind has introduced an AI model, AlphaEarth Foundations.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Meta faces Italian antitrust probe over WhatsApp AI integration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-faces-italian-antitrust-probe-over-whatsapp-ai-integration/articleshow/122996927.cms,"Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly facing competition investigation in Italy over its new AI chatbot integrated in its popular messaging app WhatsApp. As reported by Reuters, Italy’s antirust watchdog AGCM has started an investigation into Meta Platforms, alleging that the company may have abused its dominant market position by integrating its Meta AI chatbot into WhatsApp without obtaining user consent. The probe mainly revolves around concerns that embedding Meta AI directly into WhatsApp’s search bar could unfairly push users towards Meta services. This move of the company may potentially distort competition and harm rival AI platforms.“By pairing Meta AI with WhatsApp, Meta appears to be able to steer its user base into the new market not through merit-based competition, but by ‘forcing’ users to accept the availability of two distinct services,” the authority stated.AGCM also suspects that Meta’s move may also violate European Union competition rules, particularly around user autonomy and fair market access. The regulator is also investigating whether the integration was done without explicit user consent, raising privacy and ethical concerns.“Offering free access to our AI features in WhatsApp gives millions of Italians the choice to use AI in a place they already know, trust and understand,” a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.The investigation will focus on whether the AI chatbot's integration into WhatsApp could potentially restrict competition or create an unfair advantage for Meta's other services. WhatsApp boasts a massive user base in Italy, making any new feature that could steer user behaviour a subject of intense regulatory scrutiny.","Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly facing competition investigation in Italy over its new AI chatbot integrated in its popular messaging app WhatsApp. Italy’s antirust watchdog AGCM has started an investigation into Meta Platforms, alleging that the company may have abused its dominant market position.

Do smart planning with Canvas



Chrome and Lens get smarter



Search live with video input



Google is rolling out a suite of new features for its experimental AI Mode in Search. The update brings multiple new features such as PDF uploads, a dynamic Canvas planner and a deeper integration with Chrome and Google Lens. The company claims that the new features are designed to help users to learn, organise and explore more efficiently.“We’re introducing new features and capabilities for AI Mode in Search, just in time for the back-to-school season. You can already use AI Mode in the Google app on Android and iOS to ask complex questions about images, and this week the same capability is launching on desktop browsers,” said Google in a blog post.Users are now allowed to update PDF files directly into the AI Mode on desktop. This will enable the users to ask detailed questions about lecture slides, research papers or any other document. The AI Mode will analyze the file and cross-reference it with web data to deliver contextual answers and helpful links. Support for additional file types, including Google Drive documents, is expected in the coming months.The new Canvas feature allow the users to create study plans, organise tasks and refine projects over multiple sessions. Accessible via a side panel, Canvas updates dynamically as users interact with AI Mode. “AI Mode will start piecing everything together in the Canvas side panel, and you can use follow-ups to refine the output until it meets your exact requirements. Soon, the new upload feature will also make it possible to customize your study guide (or whatever you need to create) with context from your files, like class notes or a course syllabus.”AI Mode now works seamlessly with Google Lens in Chrome, enabling users to ask questions about anything on their screen—be it a diagram in a PDF or a webpage.Google is also launching Search Live, a real-time video input feature powered by Project Astra. Search Live is fully integrated with Google Lens, our visual search tool. To get started, just open Lens in the Google app, tap the Live icon, and ask whatever’s on your mind while pointing your camera. You can have a free-flowing, back-and-forth conversation with Search in AI Mode, aided by all the visual context from your live camera feed, like different angles or objects in motion.","Google is rolling out a suite of new features for its experimental AI Mode in Search.
