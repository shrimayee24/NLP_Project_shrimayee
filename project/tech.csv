Meet the Indian world champion who memorised 80 numbers in 13.5 seconds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-indian-world-champion-who-memorised-80-numbers-in-13-5-seconds/articleshow/118432579.cms,"How do you prepare for the Memory League World Championship?

What does your memory palace look like?

How much can these rooms hold?

Can you describe one of the challenges in Memory League World Championship?

Do you realise how amazing this is?

What's next?

In early Feb, Vishvaa Rajakumar , a 20-year-old Indian college student, won the Memory League World Championship , an online competition pitting people against one another with challenges like memorising the order of 80 random numbers faster than most people can tie a shoelace.Renowned neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire, who died in Jan, studied mental athletes like Rajakumar and found that many of them used the ancient Roman ""method of loci,"" a memorisation trick also known as the "" memory palace .""The technique takes several forms, but it generally involves visualising a large house and assigning memories to rooms. Mentally walking through the house fires up the hippocampus, the seahorse-shaped engine of memory deep in the brain that consumed Maguire's career.NYT asked Rajakumar about his strategies of memorisation. His answers:Hydration is very important because it helps your brain. When you memorise things, you usually sub-vocalise, and it helps to have a clear throat. Let's say you're reading a book. You're not reading it out loud, but you are vocalising within yourself. If you don't drink a lot of water, your speed will be a bit low. If you drink a lot of water, it will be more and more clear and you can read it faster.Let's say my first location is my room where I sleep. My second location is the kitchen. And the third location is my hall. The fourth location is my veranda. Another location is my bathroom. Let's say I am memorising a list of words. Let's say 10 words. What I do is, I take a pair of words, make a story out of them and place them in a location. And I take the next two words. I make a story out of them. I place them in the second location. The memory palace will help you to remember the sequence.A lot. Let's say I'm memorising 100 words. I'm making a story out of every two words. There will be a set of 50 stories. But I can't remember which one came first or which one came second. That would be a problem, right? So if I use the memory palace, I can remember which came first and which came second. So likewise, I can remember all of the 50 stories.They give you 80 random numbers that they display on a screen. You have to memorise all of those numbers as fast as possible, then click a button and a recall sheet appears. I wrote down all of the 80 digits - and I got them all right. My fastest time to memorise 80 random digits in World Championship was 13.5 seconds, so almost six digits per second.Yes, I do. I was crying.After completion of college, like in two to three months, I'll probably try to be a memory trainer and create a memory institution in India to teach other people these techniques. My goal is to make it big. NYT","Vishvaa Rajakumar, 20, won the Memory League World Championship.

Juan Soto Swaps No. 22 —Because Nothing Says ""Thanks"" Like a Brand-New Ride!



In Major League Baseball, not only do the headlines rot by numbers, but occasionally, beautiful gestures of friendship off the field become the break. Such is the case when the newest megastar in town, Juan Soto of the Mets, not only received the iconic No. 22 jersey long worn by third baseman Brett Baty , but also followed up with a lavish thank-you gift.Boulevard drama starts here, Juan Soto has worn 22 for his whole life as far as the eye can see, a good seven years to be precise-probably he would have to feel a bit awkward wearing it for the Mets. The brawniest star around- if any- Baty was with those coveted numbers. So Soto being the good, responsible teammate worked out a deal for the newer, blacked-out Chevy Tahoe worth $60,000. That is right, according to NY Post, an $60K - $90k SUV with ""Thanks for #22"" written on the rear windshield.The Mets made sure to capture the feel-good moment when they shared a video on Instagram of Baty's utter surprise as the shocked star was shown the incredible surprise gift. After being so shocked, his jaw hanging at the sight of the beautifully wrapped vehicle with a giant red bow across the hood, he muttered, ""This is sick, bro"" to no one in particular. Soto, the ever-sweet soul, said, ""I wanted to give you something nice,"" and reconfirmed that baseball is more than just numbers.In the video, Soto spoke about how much No. 22 means to him after having worn it for the entirety of his career. ""I really appreciate this number,"" he said nostalgically. ""This is the first one I ever wore."" Clearly, the gesture held great meaning for both players, turning a spontaneous gesture into the fabric of their growing friendship and respect.Baty's rise to prominence as one of the most exciting young players on the Mets thoroughly validates his shining promise on the diamond now, though he has just bagged a shiny new set of wheels for a load. Soto pretty much cemented his place as one of the most charitable stars in the game-not only through setting records but by putting together one of the warmest moments of the season.",Mets third baseman Brett Baty has been wearing No. 22 for seven years. Juan Soto of the Mets worked out a deal with Baty to swap the number for a brand-new SUV.

CHENNAI: Eggs make you healthy, but did you know their shells can help heal broken bones? A research team at Periyar University, Salem, has patented two technologies for commercial production of hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate mineral found in bones and teeth, from eggshells.These technologies use eggshells as bone grafts, coatings for dental and orthopaedic implants, and as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications.One of the patented technologies to convert eggshells into hydroxyapatite involves flowing a solution containing ground eggshells and phosphate in a microwave reactor.It rapidly and uniformly heats using microwave radiation at around 100 degrees centigrade. The resulting product contains calcium phosphate in powder form and other byproducts, which can be washed and removed.The researchers claim their technology helps in quick production of hydroxyapatite from eggshells and gives a better yield.

This requires immediate attention. If you don’t want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can do that we can move forward on solving this.

Elon Musk is the father,” she wrote. “I have not previously disclosed this to protect our child’s privacy and safety, but in recent days it has become clear that tabloid media intends to do so, regardless of the harm it will cause.”St. Clair explained that she wants their alleged child to “grow in a normal and safe environment” outside of the spotlight.The SpaceX founder, however, has not yet confirmed St. Clair’s claims and the identity of his youngest child.","Grimes, however, deleted the posts hours later.

Conclave wins best film at BAFTAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/conclave-wins-best-picture-at-baftas-as-the-brutalist-takes-directing-and-acting-prizes/articleshow/118310797.cms,"LONDON: Papal thriller “ Conclave ” won four prizes including best picture on Sunday at the 78th British Academy Film Awards , where genre-bending musical “ Emilia Pérez ” proved that it’s still an awards contender despite a multipronged backlash that looked to have dented its chances.“The Brutalist” equaled the awards tally of “Conclave,"" scooping four trophies, including best director for Brady Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

The New York Times made history on February 15, 1942, by publishing its first crossword puzzle in the Sunday Magazine. Created by Charles Erlenkotter and edited by Margaret Farrar, this marked the paper as the first major U.S. publication to feature a crossword. The decision sparked a cultural shift, making puzzles a beloved pastime for readers. Over the decades, the NYT has expanded its puzzle offerings to include the Mini Crossword (2014) and popular games such as Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, and Tiles. In 2022, the paper acquired Wordle, which became a global sensation. Building on this momentum, it later introduced games like Connections and Strands, capturing the interest of a growing community of players worldwide. The NYT continues to innovate in the puzzle space, cementing its position as a leader in engaging, mind-challenging entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, uniting puzzle enthusiasts across the globe.Having trouble solving today’s NYT Strands puzzle ?

Princess Diana: Prince Harry reveals contacting late mother Princess Diana through psychic in his memoir 'Spare',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-reveals-contacting-late-mother-princess-diana-through-psychic-in-his-memoir-spare/articleshow/117667098.cms,"File photo: Princess Diana with young William and Harry (Picture credit: X)

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Why Trump's bullying is going to backfire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-trumps-bullying-is-going-to-backfire/articleshow/118391132.cms,"wants

The scariest thing about what President Donald Trump is doing with his tariffs-for-all strategy, I believe, is that he has no clue what he is doing -- or how the world economy operates, for that matter. He's just making it all up as he goes along -- and we are all along for the ride.I am not against using tariffs to counter unfair trade practices. I supported Trump and President Joe Biden 's tariffs on China. And if all of this is just Trump bluffing to get other countries to give us the same access that we give them, I am OK with it. But Trump has never been clear: Some days he says his tariffs are to raise revenue, other days to force everyone to invest in America, other days to keep out fentanyl.So, which is it? As the Beatles sang, I'd love to see the plan. As in: Here's how we think the global economy operates today. Therefore, to strengthen America, here is where we think we need to cut spending, impose tariffs and invest -- and that is why we are doing X, Y and Z.That would be real leadership. Instead, Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on rivals and allies alike, without any satisfactory explanation of why one is being tariffed and the other not, and regardless of how such tariffs might hurt US industry and consumers. It's a total mess. As Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley courageously (compared to other CEOs) pointed out, ""Let's be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the US industry that we've never seen.""So, either Trumpto blow that hole, or he's bluffing, or he is clueless. If it is the latter, Trump is going to get a crash course in the hard realities of the global economy as it really is -- not how he imagines it.My favorite tutor in these matters is Oxford University economist Eric Beinhocker , who got my attention when we were talking the other day with the following simple statement: ""No country in the world alone can make an iPhone.""Think about that sentence for a moment: There is no single country or company on earth that has all the knowledge or parts or manufacturing prowess or raw materials that go into that device in your pocket called an iPhone. Apple says it assembles its iPhone and computers and watches with the help of ""thousands of businesses and millions of people in more than 50 countries and regions"" who contribute ""their skills, talents and efforts to help build, deliver, repair and recycle our products.""We are talking about a massive network ecosystem that is needed to make that phone so cool, so smart and so cheap. And that is Beinhocker's point: The big difference between the era we are in now, as opposed to the one Trump thinks he's living in, is that today it's no longer ""the economy, stupid."" That was the Bill Clinton era. Today, ""it's the ecosystems , stupid.""Ecosystems? Listen a bit to Beinhocker , who is also the executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School. In the real world, he argues, ""There is no such thing as the American economy anymore that you can identify in any real, tangible way. There's just this accounting fiction that we call US GDP."" To be sure, he says, ""There are American interests in the economy. There are American workers. There are American consumers. There are firms based in America. But there is no American economy in that isolated sense.""The old days, he added, ""where you made wine and I made cheese, and you had everything you needed to make wine and I had everything I needed to make cheese and so we traded with each other -- which made us both better off, as Adam Smith taught -- those days are long gone."" Except in Trump's head.Instead, there is a global web of commercial, manufacturing, services and trading ""ecosystems,"" explains Beinhocker. ""There is an automobile ecosystem. There's an AI ecosystem. There's a smartphone ecosystem. There's a drug development ecosystem. There is the chipmaking ecosystem."" And the people, parts and knowledge that make up those ecosystems all move back and forth across many economies.As NPR noted in a recent story about the auto industry, ""carmakers have built a vast, complicated supply chain that spans North America, with parts crossing back and forth across borders throughout the auto manufacturing process.Some parts cross borders multiple times -- like, say, a wire that is manufactured in the US, sent to Mexico to be bundled into a group of wires, and then back to the US for installation into a bigger piece of a car, like a seat.""Trump just waves off all of this. He told reporters that the US is not reliant on Canada. ""We don't need them to make our cars,"" he said.Actually, we do. And thank goodness for that. It not only enables us to make cars cheaper, but also better. All that a Model T did was get you from point to point faster than a horse, but today's cars offer you heating and cooling and entertainment from the internet and satellites. They will navigate for you and even drive for you -- and they're much safer. When we can combine more complex knowledge and complex parts to solve complex problems, our quality of life soars.But here's the catch. You cannot make complex stuff alone anymore. It's too complex.In a 2021 essay on the website of the Yale School of Public Health, Swati Gupta , head of emerging infectious diseases at IAVI, a nonprofit scientific research organization, explained how mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 were developed in record time:""Vaccines traditionally take 10-20 years to develop, and research and testing costs can easily mount into the billions of dollars. So the natural question in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is: How were the currently available vaccines developed so quickly? There was unprecedented global collaboration through coordinated partnerships among governments, industry, donor organizations, nonprofits and academia. It's the only way we could have achieved what has been seen in the past year, as no one group could have done this alone.""Ditto today for the most advanced microchips. They are now made by a global ecosystem: AMD, Qualcomm, Intel, Apple and Nvidia excel at the design of chips. Synopsys and Cadence create sophisticated computer-aided design tools and software on which chipmakers actually draw up their newest ideas. Applied Materials creates and modifies the materials to forge the billions of transistors and connecting wires in the chip. ASML, a Dutch company, provides the lithography tools in partnership with, among others, Carl Zeiss SMT, a German company specializing in optical lenses, which draws the stencils on the silicon wafers from those designs.

""That was great,"" Beinhocker notes. ""But the more powerful engine is the division of knowledge. That is what is required to make more complex things than pins. You have to harness a division of knowledge, a division of expertise.""If you stand back and look at the big sweep of economic history, Beinhocker explains, ""it is really a story of scaling up our networks of cooperation to harness and share knowledge to make more complex products and services that give us higher and higher standards of living. And if you are not part of these ecosystems, your country will not thrive.""And trust is the essential ingredient that makes these ecosystems work and grow, Beinhocker adds. Trust acts as both glue and grease. It glues together bonds of cooperation, while at the same time it greases the flows of people, products, capital and ideas from one country to the next. Remove trust and the ecosystems start to collapse.Trust, though, is built by good rules and healthy relationships, and Trump is trampling on both.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock.
