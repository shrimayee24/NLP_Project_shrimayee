Sometimes, not even a smartwatch. This is the lesson a passenger at Jabalpur station learned the hard way last week when his online samosa payment stalled and his train began chugging out.The passenger handed over his watch when a vendor allegedly grabbed his collar, threatening him and demanding payment for the snack and some other food items worth around Rs 180.The customer had got off a passing train briefly at Jabalpur to buy food on Oct 17. A viral video shows the vendor turning violent even as others look on. Realising he would miss his train, the passenger is seen quickly removing his smartwatch and handing it to the vendor before scampering to board his moving train.

Police said he had been warned against repeating such misbehaviour.The episode unfolded on Platform no. 5. The passenger attempted to make the digital payment by scanning a QR code but the transaction failed. As the train began to move, he tried leaving, triggering the fracas with the vendor attached to Kanchan Restaurant on the platform.After the clip surfaced on social media, RPF took suo motu cognisance of a complaint posted on Twitter and summoned the vendor for questioning on Oct 18.","The customer had got off a passing train briefly at Jabalpur to buy food on Oct 17.

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says AI systems can ace elite competitions yet fail at elementary school problems.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch.He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Who is Niklas Elmehed: The man behind the iconic illustrations of the 2025 Nobel laureates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-niklas-elmehed-the-man-behind-the-iconic-illustrations-of-the-2025-nobel-laureates/articleshow/124624619.cms,"Niklas Elmehed’s journey to the Nobel laureates illustrations



Behind the scenes





When the world tunes in every October to see the latest Nobel Prize winners , the first images that greet audiences are not photographs but striking gold-and-black portraits. Behind these instantly recognisable illustrations is Niklas Elmehed, a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB. Known for combining classical portraiture with modern illustration, Elmehed has been creating the official portraits of laureates since 2012, turning the announcement of the world’s most prestigious awards into a visual spectacle. Working under strict confidentiality, he completes each hand-painted portrait within hours of learning the winners’ names, ensuring the images reach a global audience almost instantly.Elmehed studied fine arts in Sweden and brings extensive experience in digital and print design. His work spans journalism, history, and fine art, capturing the achievements of leading scientists, writers, and peace advocates in a single, iconic image. As Art Director at Nobel Media AB, he oversees all visual content for Nobel announcements, blending precision, storytelling, and aesthetic appeal to create portraits that convey both dignity and immediacy.Before Elmehed, Nobel laureate announcements often relied on low-quality photographs sourced from institutional websites. He introduced hand-painted portraits with black outlines on a white background, accentuated by shimmering gold foil. This design, formalised during the Nobel Prize’s 2017 graphical rebranding, adds a timeless quality and a sense of prestige, symbolising the legacy of the Nobel tradition while giving each laureate a unique visual identity.Secrecy is a key part of Elmehed’s process. He is among the very few outside the Nobel committees to learn winners’ names in advance. Working under tight deadlines, he paints rapidly without compromising detail or quality. His portraits are completed just in time for the announcements, allowing media outlets worldwide to immediately share the iconic images alongside the news.In 2025, Elmehed unveiled “The Golden Wall”, exhibiting all Nobel portraits of the year at Nobel headquarters in Stockholm. This year’s portraits, including Medicine laureates Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, were shared across official Nobel social media platforms. Beyond the Nobel Prize, Elmehed has showcased his work internationally, from TEDxPatras 2025, where he discussed the storytelling power of faces, to a live painting performance at the Nordic Pavilion of World Expo 2025 in Osaka.For Elmehed, each portrait is more than art; it is a form of visual storytelling. He aims to produce works that reflect the immediacy of breaking news while immortalising laureates with elegance and clarity. His goal is to give each portrait a strong and unique visual impression, capturing the world’s foremost minds in a style that is instantly recognisable and timeless.","Niklas Elmehed is a Stockholm-based visual artist and Art Director at Nobel Media AB.

Abu Dhabi launches new traffic Black Points and licence reinstatement campaign: Here's what every motorist must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-launches-new-traffic-black-points-and-licence-reinstatement-campaign-heres-what-every-motorist-must-know/articleshow/124688843.cms,"Abu Dhabi Police introduce a new program to reduce traffic Black Points and reinstate suspended driving licences. Image: AI Representative Image.

Black Points system: How does the new program work?

Steps to avail services

Visit the Abu Dhabi Police platform on the first floor of Mushrif Mall Centre during the program period. Choose between point reduction (if under 24 points) or licence reinstatement (if suspended). Pay the applicable fee (Dh 800 for reduction, Dh 2,400 for reinstatement). Attend the educational courses and workshops in person. Complete the program to have points reduced or licence reinstated.

Abu Dhabi's context for broader traffic safety

Quick recap

Date Time Location Eligibility Service Process Mode Fee (AED) Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with fewer than 24 black points Reduce Black Points Attend traffic safety workshops In-person only 800 Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with suspended licences (24+ points) Reinstate Licence Enroll in rehabilitation courses and complete education In-person only 2,400





Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences, running from October 20 to November 20, 2025. This one-month program operates daily between 4 pm and 10 pm at the Mushrif Mall Centre, first-floor Police platform, and aims to promote safer roads through education, making it easier for motorists to rectify violations.Black points are demerit points given out for serious traffic violations and accumulate according to how dangerous the offence is. Once a driver hits 24 points within a year, their licence usually gets suspended. This program gives drivers two clear options: lower their black points or reinstate a suspended licence.If you have fewer than 24 black points, you can attend specially designed workshops and educational courses to reduce up to eight points from your record. These sessions focus on educating drivers about traffic rules, safe driving habits, and the consequences of violations. The fee for this course is Dh800.For those whose licences have been suspended after surpassing 24 points, the route to reinstatement involves enrolling in a more comprehensive rehabilitation course. Upon successful completion and payment of Dh2,400, your driving licence can be restored. This educative approach helps ensure that reinstated drivers are better informed and more cautious moving forward.Importantly, the program is strictly an in-person affair. Motorists must physically be present at the Mushrif Mall Centre during the dates and timings because there is no online registration or virtual participation option. This ensures that participants get the full benefit of interacting with trainers and engaging in the corrective sessions.The initiative clearly reflects Abu Dhabi Police’s ongoing dedication to community safety by actively encouraging voluntary compliance and shared responsibility rather than resorting solely to fines and suspensions. It also builds on earlier successful efforts such as similar awareness programs launched at major events like the Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition (ADIHEX) earlier in the year.Black point penalties continue to stay on a driver’s record for one year, and avoiding violations during that time can help clear them. Drivers also have the ability to contest fines or have points transferred if the actual offender is identified. Along with various awareness campaigns, such as “A Day Without Accident,” these efforts collectively aim at fostering a safer road environment for all.In summary, Abu Dhabi aims to encourage safer driving habits, reduce accidents, and improve overall road safety. Mark your calendar, take advantage of this important initiative and get your driving record back on track.","Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences.

This guidance applies to all private sector workers across the UAE.These clarifications make it easier for workers to know exactly what they are entitled to, whether it’s pay, overtime, or leave.

Twitch's Official Response

Community Backlash

Moving Forward





Twitch has recently released a statement on the viral incident related to the Twitch streamer Emiru. Essentially, the popular internet personality was assaulted during a meet-and-greet at TwitchCon. This has resulted in a massive backlash within the community regarding the security lapse.Regarding all the concerns, the streaming platform released a statement on its social media handles, clarifying its stand. They also condemned the behavior of the individual involved in the incident. The following section provides further details on the incident and Twitch’s statement related to the same.Following the Emiru assault incident, Twitch has released a comprehensive statement on X. The statement read: “The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority. The behavior displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high-profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.”The statement further added that law enforcement officials were present on-site at TwitchCon and responded immediately to the incident, ensuring swift action was taken.Furthermore, the platform has confirmed that the perpetrator has been permanently banned from Twitch platform and all Twitch-affiliated events. This is a much-needed action from them, as these kinds of acts are certainly not acceptable.In response to the incident, Twitch has also announced that it will be increasing the security protocols at the meet-and-greet check-in areas. Their exact statement read: “We have increased security at the Meet & Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. If you’ve RSVPed for a Meet & Greet, please note that we are unable to accommodate +1s for the remainder of the event. ”These enhanced security measures will help ensure that incidents similar to this are prevented, and there is a safer environment for both creators and attendees.Despite Twitch's statement on the matter, the streaming community is quite critical of the platform and has been raising several questions. Many streamers, including Valkyrae and Asmongold, have criticized the platform. Valkyrae even pointed out that Emiru was previously denied permission to have her preferred personal security guard present at the event. This decision was quite questionable, given that it led to her vulnerability.Although Twitch's statement is an important acknowledgment of the safety concerns raised, there are further protocols that must be taken to ensure that the creators don’t face incidents like this. Critics have been arguing that the platform must respect creators' security preferences and provide adequate protective measures.",Twitch has recently released a statement on the viral incident related to the Twitch streamer Emiru.

What are these diagnostic assessments and why now?

How the assessments will work: Timing, subjects and implementation

What it means for students, parents and teachers

Challenges and what to watch for





UAE schools are stepping into the new academic year with a smarter approach to learning, introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on. Starting this term, the Ministry of Education will roll out the new system across public schools, aiming to close learning gaps before they grow and help teachers tailor lessons to every child’s needs.Starting the 2025-26 academic year, schools across the Ministry of Education – UAE will introduce new diagnostic assessments early in the term, designed to identify learning gaps and support targeted teaching. These assessments will help teachers and schools understand each child’s strengths and weaknesses from the outset, rather than waiting until end-term exams.This move comes amid broader education reforms in the UAE, including the rollout of an AI curriculum and revised assessment policy.The diagnostic assessments will take place during the early weeks of the term, across key subjects such as Arabic, English and Mathematics for core grades (4-11) in public schools. For example, the first phase of a standardised proficiency test covers 26,000 students in Grades 4–11.Additionally, the exam schedule is re-structured: centralised tests now occur only in the first and third semesters, while the second semester moves to school-based assessments. The aim: teachers get early feedback, adapt teaching, and support students before gaps widen.For students, the change means less waiting and more support. Teachers will receive data early on to tailor lessons and interventions. Parents will have clearer insight into how their child is performing from the start. Schools gain a data-driven foundation to allocate resources and target help where it’s most needed. For teachers, this means working with richer feedback and adjusting lesson pacing and methods. Schools say diagnostic checks help them “identify learning gaps and provide tailored support before the next phase.”For the system, it signals a shift from high-stakes, end-of-term judgments to ongoing, formative evaluation, aimed at deeper learning rather than rote memorisation.While the initiative is promising, success depends on consistent implementation. Schools will need training, reliable data systems, and clarity around how the diagnostic results are used. Teachers may need professional development to interpret the data and act on it effectively. The Ministry has already rolled out training programmes for thousands of educators ahead of the year. There is also a need to ensure equity: private and public schools alike must have access and capacity for these assessments. Monitoring how the data translates into real improvement will be key.With the launch of early diagnostic assessments in the UAE’s 2025-26 school year, the education system is moving from reactive to proactive. By spotting learning gaps at the start, supporting students from day one and giving teachers better tools, the country hopes to raise outcomes, reduce pressure and build a foundation for future-ready learning.","UAE schools are introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on.

Whether celebrating in public spaces or at home, dispose of waste properly. Littering after fireworks or festivities damages public property and the environment.

Crowded areas require attention to personal safety. Families with children should stay alert, especially near fireworks zones or food stalls. Respect cultural and religious diversity:



The spirit of Diwali should be one of inclusivity, not inconvenience. Any public celebrations should aim to bring people together rather than create noise or disruptions.





As of 2025, Dubai’s population has crossed seven million, and nearly two million Indian expatriates make up the city’s largest and most close-knit community. For them, Diwali is far more than a festive occasion — it’s a vital cultural anchor in a city defined by ambition and relentless pace.Every year, Dubai lights up with Diwali celebrations that span the entire spectrum: spectacular public events with government-approved fireworks and laser shows, elaborate displays in shopping malls and hotels, and intimate gatherings across Indian residential hubs such as Bur Dubai, Karama, and Discovery Gardens.But behind the glow lies a framework of order. Dubai’s strict regulations govern everything from firecracker use and event permits to public safety and crowd control.The big question every Diwali celebrant asks is simple: Are fireworks banned in Dubai? The answer is both yes and no. While private use, sale, and possession of fireworks are strictly prohibited, licensed and government-approved venues are permitted to hold official pyrotechnic displays.This means fireworks can light up the sky, but only where authorities have given explicit permission. Illegal fireworks, whether set off in residential areas or sold without a license, are treated as explosives under UAE law.Penalties include up to 3 months imprisonment or a fine of up to AED 5,000 for selling, using, or distributing fireworks. Additionally, parents can be held legally accountable if minors are involved in illegal fireworks use.Ahead of Diwali, authorities conduct rigorous enforcement campaigns, seizing illegal fireworks to prevent unsafe neighborhood celebrations. Residents are encouraged to report any suspected illegal activity through the Dubai Police app or by calling 901.For those legitimately aiming to host fireworks displays, securing a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority is strictly mandatory. However, this legal option is limited to licensed businesses only, specifically for entertainment purposes—not individual residents. The simple application process is straightforward, involving online registration, instant approval upon payment, and a small fee structure that includes AED 2,000 plus minor administrative and processing charges.In essence, fireworks in Dubai are a privilege reserved for official, regulated events. This tight framework reflects the city’s commitment to safety, order, and respect for its diverse population during Diwali.So, where can you dive into the Diwali fun and catch dazzling fireworks lighting up the Dubai sky? The city has confirmed several key spots where fireworks displays and vibrant festivities will take place. These government-approved events are free and open to everyone, offering fantastic opportunities to engage with the celebrations and enjoy the festival’s sparkle.The authorized fireworks schedule for Diwali 2025 is as follows:Visitors should plan to arrive early given the expected large crowds. Dubai Police and the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) actively monitor these venues to maintain safety and crowd control.But Diwali in Dubai extends beyond fireworks. Several key locations offer vibrant cultural experiences throughout the festival:The waterfront transforms into a cultural Diwali village with traditional décor, floating diyas, heritage market stalls, and live performances as part of the immersive Noor Festival experience from October 17–19.The Indian Pavilion comes alive with cultural dance shows, handicrafts, vibrant décor, and street food. Fireworks light up the sky on select nights, making it a festive hotspot for all ages.Home to the spectacular IMAGINE light and fountain show synced to Bollywood hits, the mall also features Diwali-themed shopping deals, Indian food pop-ups, and family-friendly entertainment across the promenade.Expect Diwali-themed light projections on the world’s tallest tower and musical performances at the Dubai Fountain, offering dramatic visuals and ideal photo backdrops for visitors and residents alike.These buzzing neighbourhoods are a sensory overload of lights, music, and colour. Streets overflow with sweet shops, festive markets, traditional attire, and last-minute Diwali shopping well into the night.Together, these venues reflect the city’s vibrant, multicultural embrace of Diwali, catering to families, expatriates, tourists, and long-term residents alike.Among the many vibrant Diwali festivities across the city, one stands out as the official, government-backed centerpiece: Noor: Festival of Lights, running from October 17–19 at Souk Al Seef. Organized by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in partnership with the Indian Consulate and Teamwork Arts, this spectacular flagship event transforms the historic waterfront into a lively cultural Diwali village filled with music, art, and community spirit.Highlights include:“Noor,” meaning “light” in Arabic, embodies the spirit of Diwali, symbolizing unity, renewal, and togetherness. Organizers present it as a “home away from home” for Dubai’s Indian community and a celebration that bridges cultures within the city’s diverse fabric.As the city comes alive with vibrant lights, music, and joyful festive celebration, there's also a growing important reminder: Diwali in Dubai isn’t just about enjoying the spectacular spectacle—it’s about doing so responsibly and safely. In a place as culturally diverse and densely populated as this, festivities should actively uplift the wider community experience, not disrupt it. Authorities and civic leaders are strongly urging all residents to be mindful, respectful, and clean as they actively take part in the celebrations.Dubai’s law enforcement and safety departments will be closely monitoring public areas during Diwali. Residents are encouraged to enjoy all official events but are reminded that any illegal or inconsiderate behavior will be met with firm action.","Dubai’s confirmed Diwali fireworks will take place at Al Seef on October 17 and Global Village on October 18, 19, 24, and 25. While private use, sale, and possession of fireworks are strictly prohibited, licensed and government- approved venues are permitted to hold official pyrotechnic displays.

Explained: How New York’s rich and famous are panicking about Zohran Mamdani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-new-yorks-rich-and-famous-are-panicking-about-zohran-mamdani/articleshow/124668312.cms,"NYC Mayoral Debate Heats Up: Watch Mamdani & Cuomo’s Fiery Clash Over Hamas, Islamophobia &…

The Fear: “How did this happen?”



The Rage: “How dare he?”

The Shock: “This wasn’t supposed to happen”

The Grudging Acceptance: “Maybe the guillotine isn’t coming”



The Big picture





There’s a special kind of panic that only the ultra-rich can experience — the kind that hits when they realise the world they built, the one with helicopter rides to the Hamptons, $50,000-a-year pre-schools, and mayoral candidates who take their calls, might be slipping away. And right now, that panic has a name: Zohran Mamdani In the Pilates studios of the Upper East Side and the wine-soaked dinner tables of Tribeca, he’s become an existential threat disguised as a 33-year-old socialist. The man from Queens who talks about free buses and rent freezes is leading the mayoral race — and Manhattan’s wealthiest residents are losing their collective cool.The very people who believed they ran New York — the hedge fund billionaires, the podcasting wives, the real estate tycoons — are suddenly discovering their influence isn’t what it used to be. They’ve tried everything: whispered deals to clear the field for a centrist saviour, million-dollar donations to anti-Mamdani PACs, desperate strategy sessions over caviar. But Mamdani’s campaign, fuelled by a younger, angrier, and poorer electorate, is steamrolling their efforts.The disbelief is almost comical. Some donors admit that they’d rather have a deeply unpopular Cuomo in office because, by comparison, he looks like Winston Churchill.Others confess they never realised how much resentment was bubbling beneath the surface until Mamdani’s primary victory slapped them awake. For a class used to shaping reality with money and access, it’s like watching gravity stop working.Mamdani hasn’t just challenged New York’s elite — he’s mocked them. One campaign ad, featuring an actor lampooning rich people for complaining about socialism while eating lobster, ricocheted through Manhattan’s wealthiest ZIP codes. The reaction? Equal parts outrage and reluctant admiration. Many of the city’s power brokers are furious that they’re being openly caricatured, but they’re also unsettled by how effective the message has been.It’s not just politics anymore — it’s cultural warfare. The private school crowd is now playing “what if” scenarios over lunch: What if taxes go up? What if crime returns? What if we move to Miami, or Israel, or at least our second homes in Bedford? Most of them admit, behind closed doors, that they’ll probably stay put. But the very fact that they’re asking those questions reveals a deeper fear — that they’re no longer in control of the script.For decades, New York’s elite operated under a simple assumption: that money and influence could keep radical politics at bay. Mamdani has shattered that illusion. His campaign has built a coalition that isn’t swayed by threats of capital flight or lectures about how “job creators” keep the city afloat. These are voters who don’t care if billionaires threaten to decamp to Florida — because they were never invited to the billionaire parties in the first place.Even Mamdani’s nods to moderation — trimming the city bureaucracy, using tech in schools — haven’t eased their anxiety. Free buses and childcare might sound utopian to working-class New Yorkers, but they’re meaningless to people who spend more on their dog walkers than most families spend on rent. The disconnect is profound, and it’s making the city’s elite realise how out of touch they’ve become.Some in the 1% are slowly talking themselves down from the ledge. A few believe Mamdani might keep the current police commissioner, which would soothe Wall Street’s nerves. Others are even cheering him on, cynically betting that a socialist mayor will cause such chaos that voters will swing hard to the right in the next election. And then there are those quietly making contingency plans: more time in Europe, more weeks in the Hamptons, maybe a pied-à-terre in Rome — just in case.The panic isn’t about policies anymore. It’s about power. Mamdani represents the first serious threat to New York’s elite since the Gilded Age — a reminder that political gravity still pulls downward, and that wealth alone can’t guarantee control. One retired banker summed it up with weary resignation: it’s not as if the guillotine is being rolled into Central Park. But for a class used to dictating the terms of civic life, even the hint of losing their grip feels like a revolution.This is what class anxiety looks like in 2025: Pilates instructors gossiping about socialism, billionaires plotting over pasta, and Manhattan’s most powerful people asking each other if they should flee before the buses become free. Mamdani hasn’t even won yet, and he’s already forcing the city’s ruling class to confront an uncomfortable truth — that their era of uncontested dominance might be ending.And that, more than any policy or promise, is what’s keeping them awake at night.","Zohran Mamdani is leading the mayoral race and Manhattan’s wealthiest residents are losing their collective cool.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
