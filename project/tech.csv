According to ESPN, the veteran quarterback has agreed to a two-year contract worth $8 million, with $4.5 million guaranteed.Rudolph, who previously spent several seasons with the Steelers, was a reliable backup and occasional starter during his first stint with the team. Last season, he explored his options in free agency and had interest from multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans. However, after considering his opportunities, he ultimately decided to reunite with the Steelers.Also Read: Buccaneers sign ex-Lions CB Kindle Vildor in new deal The return of Mason Rudolph provides Pittsburgh with stability at the quarterback position, particularly as the team looks to navigate the challenges of the upcoming season.

Total lunar eclipse in the US: Timings and how to watch

What not to do during Blood Moon and Total Lunar Eclipse

Don’t Expect Instant Color Changes – The Moon won’t turn red all at once. The shift happens gradually as Earth's shadow covers it, so be patient.

Avoid Bright Lights – Streetlights, phone screens, and indoor lighting can make it harder to see the eclipse clearly. Try watching from a dark location for the best view.

Don’t Use Solar Eclipse Glasses – Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye. You don’t need any protective eyewear.

Don’t Rely Only on the Naked Eye – While you can see the eclipse without equipment, using binoculars or a telescope will enhance the experience by revealing more details.

Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute – Lunar eclipses last for hours, but the total eclipse phase is shorter. Know the exact timing so you don’t miss the Blood Moon at its peak.



Next lunar eclipse in 2025

A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late Thursday and early Friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a Blood Moon . This is the only lunar eclipse visible from the US this year and the first total lunar eclipse since November 2022. The entire event will last around six hours, with the best views expected across North and South America, though it will be visible throughout the Western Hemisphere.A total lunar eclipse happens when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, causing the Moon to pass through Earth's darkest shadow. During this, the Moon takes on a reddish or copper hue, earning the name Blood Moon. This color change happens because sunlight filters through Earth's atmosphere, projecting the colors of sunrises and sunsets onto the Moon.The eclipse begins with a penumbral phase at 11:57 PM EDT (8:57 PM PDT) Thursday. The partial eclipse starts at 1:09 AM EDT (10:09 PM PDT) Friday, making it look like a ""bite"" is taken out of the Moon. The most dramatic phase, totality, occurs at 2:26 AM EDT (11:26 PM PDT) Friday, when the Moon will glow red. Totality ends at 3:31 AM EDT (12:31 AM PDT), and the eclipse fully concludes by sunrise.Unlike a solar eclipse, this event doesn’t require special glasses—just step outside and look up. A dark location away from city lights will offer the best view, and using binoculars or a telescope can enhance the experience. If the weather isn’t ideal, websites like Timeanddate.com will livestream the event starting at 1 AM EDT Friday.This month's full Moon, called the Worm Moon, will reach peak illumination at 2:55 AM EDT Friday and will appear full for three nights. The name comes from the Maine Farmers' Almanac, which documented Native American names for full moons in the 1930s.The next total lunar eclipse will happen on September 7, 2025, visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The U.S. won’t see another total lunar eclipse until March 3, 2026.Looking ahead, the next solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, as a partial eclipse visible from multiple continents, followed by another on September 21, 2025.","A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late Thursday and early Friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a Blood Moon.

The leaked images, shared by leaker Sonny Dickson, reveal the new ‘Air’ model that makes current iPhone models look bulky by comparison.The iPhone 17 Air appears to be approximately 5.5mm thin, a significant reduction from current models. Side-by-side comparisons in Dickson's leaked images highlight this striking difference, with standard iPhone 17 models appearing substantially thicker.According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 6.6-inch display, positioning it between the smaller Pro and larger Pro Max models. Apple reportedly considered an even larger 6.9-inch screen but abandoned the idea due to concerns about potential bending issues.Despite its slimmer profile, Gurman reports the device will maintain battery life comparable to current iPhones through redesigned internal components and enhanced power efficiency. The Air model is expected to include high-end features like a ProMotion 120Hz display and the Camera Control button, while making compromises with a single rear camera and standard A19 chip rather than the Pro variant.The dummy units confirm previous rumors about the phone's design, including slim bezels similar to the iPhone 16 Pro series and the Dynamic Island cutout at the top of the display. The dummies also show a phone-spanning camera bump across most iPhone 17 models, except the the vanilla iPhone 17, which still has the pill-shaped module, same as the iPhone 16.Gurman suggests the Air model, anticipated to cost around $900. If successful, this could lead to completely port-free iPhones and even influence Apple's rumored foldable device expected by 2026.","The iPhone 17 Air appears to be approximately 5.5mm thin, a significant reduction from current models.

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen?

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How Yamato makes ThinkPads just work



Beyond the lab



Behind a nondescript building in Yokohama , Japan , stands the legendary Yamato Lab . This is no typical research facility. It's a place where laptops are not pampered, but systematically pushed to breaking point – and then pushed some more. This is where ThinkPad was born, and now ThinkPads are transformed from mere machines to some of the most durable computing devices known to humankind, engineered to withstand the rigors of daily professional use.Enter the Yamato lab, and you'd think it'd look something like a sterile research lab but it turned out to be a maze of calculated torture chambers for ThinkPads. I watched, slightly wincing, as a ThinkPad was systematically dropped, twisted, and pressed under weights that would make most consumer electronics crumble.Drop tests that simulate a clumsy commuter's worst nightmare? Check. Vibration tests that mimic being jostled in a backpack during a bumpy train ride? Absolutely. Chambers that swing the laptops to their last? You bet.Hinges might seem like the most mundane part of a laptop, and you would just pass it on as an innocuous connection between screen and laptop, but they undergo a relentless opening and closing cycle at Yamato Lab. Automated arms repeatedly open and shut the laptop thousands of times, checking for precise movement, cable integrity, and structural stability.The technician demoing the test for us notes that each hinge is tested to withstand not just gentle touches, but the aggressive slams of stressed executives, the casual drops, and the constant repositioning that comes with a mobile work life.In another room, stress testing takes on an almost surgical precision. Flat circular disks of various sizes – mimicking everything from a carelessly placed heavy book to the accidental pressure of a backpack – apply controlled pressure to the closed laptop lid. These tests aren't just about preventing cracks; they're about ensuring structural integrity under unexpected stresses.Silently doing its work in another corner of the stress testing room, a machine applies systematic pressure to an open laptop display, trying to mimic the action of fingertips pushing the screen to entire palms just forcing the lid down, testing its screen's ability to resist twisting and bending without damaging the pixels.I watched as these machines gradually put all their force on the ThinkPads, testing their ability to withstand compression without compromising internal components.The impact testing is nothing short of brutal. Moved to the other section and a technician was demoing the corner-drop test, where the laptop is deliberately dropped onto a hard surface, landing precisely on its most vulnerable point.Vibration tests are equally intense. A specially designed table randomly shakes a laptop, mimicking the jostle of a commuter's bag, the bumpy ride of a taxi, or the turbulence of a business-class flight.Nearby, a technician casually stands on a ThinkPad X1 Carbon — a sight that would make any computer owner wince, and not just once but multiple times. I did ask them to jump on it, but they didn't, could be the language barrier or could also be it's breaking point.But, where most laptops would crumple like a tin can, this machine remains steadfast, its carbon fiber and magnesium chassis absorbing the weight without so much as a whimper — and that's something to really boast about.That's not even all the brutality that a ThinkPad goes through. Our guide, a meticulous Japanese engineer with decades of experience, tells us these are only a few of about tens of different tests that the folks at Yamato put the ThinkPad through, and each one he says is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that go far beyond the typical wear and tear.Now the Yamato Lab isn't just about creating indestructible machines. It's also about understanding how professionals work, and what's even more important to people who take dozens of calls a day more than they look great and the sound just comes through, and the calls just happen. So, I headed to another floor, which had a room where technicians were testing the three things that you can't just work without — webcam, speaker and the wireless connectivity.In the camera testing area, a wall of diverse skin tones and lighting scenarios created a mini-studio of complexity. Engineers meticulously adjusted white balance, tested color accuracy, and ran AI processing to ensure that every video call renders human features true to life, regardless of lighting conditions or background complexity. There were two ThinkPads, including the newer X1 Carbon, and the difference the investment was clearly visible. One thing though, there were a lot of heads, and they looked horrifically realistic.Next up was the acoustics room, a hemi-anechoic chamber that absorbs sound so completely that the silence feels almost tangible. With high-precision microphones surrounding the test bench, the speakers inside the ThinkPad are subjected to a battery of tests that go far beyond simple measurements.Engineers spend hours sitting in this silent room analyzing every nuance of sound reproduction, mapping out frequency responses, distortion levels, and audio clarity across different volume ranges. Laptop speakers have always been an afterthought, but the room shows how much thought is behind even an afterthought here at Yamato.Wireless connectivity testing looked like something between a radio observatory and a tech bunker, it definitely looked something like straight out of a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie. Inside, a ThinkPad was strapped onto a precision-engineered rotating platform, rotating in 360-degrees in a radio-wave-absorbing chamber, so that technicians could measure signal strength, stability and performance from every conceivable angle.Again, this was just a peek at how Yamato keeps the essentials in check, so their ThinkPad just works when it needs to. But there is a lot more going behind the scenes. A whole bunch of engineers working on the TrackPoint , yes that red nub in middle of the keyboard, it has its own design process.As we left the Yamato facility, our guide took us to the adjacent ThinkPad museum. Here, decades of innovation were displayed chronologically, from the original models to modern iterations. We admired a gold-plated commemorative ThinkPad that gleamed under the museum lights, alongside an early prototype with an extending display—surprisingly innovative long before today's concept of expandable screens. There were many more.A ThinkPad was so unique to see was the one having a bento box-shaped compartments inside the keyboard. Fun fact: the original ThinkPad design was inspired by Japanese bento boxes, with similar dimensions and internal components arranged in compartmentalized sections, reflecting the thoughtful organization that has defined the brand.Interestingly, many of the original engineers who started with IBM still work here. They've watched the ThinkPad transform from a relatively bulky productivity tool into a sleek, AI-enabled device. Yet through all these evolutions, the core philosophy has remained steadfast: create a laptop that just gets its user through their workday no matter how tough it gets out there.","Yamato Lab in Yokohama, Japan, is where ThinkPad was born.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.
