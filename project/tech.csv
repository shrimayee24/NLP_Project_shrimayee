, your characteristic style of

flat writing

, this mundane detail of life, was not in vogue in

literature

. How did you develop it and why did you find merit in adopting it?

Listen to the full interview:

Memory, Language, and Liberty: Annie Ernaux on the Essence of Writing

Q. So which is your preferred mode of writing?

Q. Your writing often tackles the economics of existence. Your family exercised financial prudence. And yet you studied modern literature, as you rightly point out, was considered as bourgeoisie. Later, as your writing career flourished, did the financial independence that it afforded define or transform your craft in any manner?

Q. How important is your freedom to you? Does it come from the ability to express in your language that enables it?

Annie Ernaux was born in Normandy, where her parents ran a cafe and grocery in the working class part of town. Some of her prominent works are A Man's Place, The Years, Simple Passion, A Woman's Story, Exteriors, etc.From her working-class origins to her exploration of memory and language, Ernaux discusses the evolution of her craft and the importance of culture and freedom in her life and work.Excerpts from the interview:Q. When you beganA. Well, it's a bit long to explain, but I will try. So, initially, I did not start writing with this style. If you look at my first three books, the style of writing was the one that depicts a certain violence. But then later on, when I started with a book which spoke about my father's life, who was a worker from a working class, and then who had a small grocery cafe at this time, I realised that the violent style of writing did not correspond to writing his life. And then I wanted to shift to something which would just describe facts, which would write facts. And this is what you all call as flat writing. And this is term that I later started using myself. And so it all comes from the subject that I'm talking about. So initially in my books, the first books that I wrote were about my life and myself and that had a violent tone to it. And then eventually, when I moved on to write by my father, it had to be more real. It had to be something that depicted his life and to which the violence did not correspond. So the style of flat writing, as you call it, is something that comes from my confrontation with the reality.A. So it all depends on what I want to write and what I want to say. And I write a lot in first person, because writing in first person, for me, is an instrument of having access to a certain knowledge that allows me to tackle things more directly. And that's how I have written a lot of my books. But when you talk about books, like The Years, for me, the subject is the third person, because it's the story of a woman, a woman's life, but a life which is immersed in a broader historical context, in this case, the history of France. And there I erased the first person because I wanted to express things from the point of view of this woman's life that was being narrated. And in another book, A Girl's Story, the first person I write is for the narrator, myself, and then the third person is for the character, you know, an 18-year-old girl whose story is being narrated. So it all depends on what I wish to narrate and what I wish to say about things.A. I don't think so. In writing, what defines me is the memory and memories of childhood, of adolescence, and of all these important phases that constitute important elements in an individual's life. And all this in a world which is economically and culturally dominated by another class. And so the fact of having financial ease did not really shape or influence my writings in any way. And that's one of the reasons I continue to teach, because I doubted if my books would fetch me enough money. And writing, therefore, was not really a means of earning money, but an aspiration to write what I felt and to write the way I conceived writing in my mind.A. Well, indeed, lack of money, as you say, is one of the first things that mention at this point. And this lack of money comes from several factors. For example, having no work, or to have no inheritance, or to have nobody in your family who would help you, right? For me, the real source of liberty, as you call it, is language and culture. And this fundamental source of liberty is to have a culture that allows you to judge and evaluate your own position in the world. And this is one of the first and foremost wealths that I can think of.","Annie Ernaux was born in Normandy, where her parents ran a cafe and grocery.

Titan submersible's fatal dive: Communication log between vessel and mother ship revealed to be fake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/titan-submersibles-fatal-dive-communication-log-between-vessel-and-mother-ship-revealed-to-be-fake/articleshow/110902938.cms,"NEW DELHI: A shocking revelation has emerged in the investigation into the tragic descent of the Titan submersible towards the Titanic wreckage . The transcript purportedly detailing the communications between the submersible and its mother ship during the fatal journey has been exposed as entirely fabricated, according to Mirror.

Last summer, the release of the communications record stirred widespread concern as it depicted a harrowing sequence of events that turned what was intended as a routine descent into a desperate struggle for survival. The transcript documented the futile attempts of the five passengers to return to the surface amid a series of alarming occurrences.

However, following an exhaustive year-long investigation, the federal investigation team in the United States has confirmed that the transcript is fraudulent. Chairman of the marine board of investigation, Captain Jason D Neubauer, unequivocally said, ""I have no doubt that this transcript is fake. It was made up.""

The investigation failed to uncover any evidence suggesting that the occupants of the Titan were aware of the impending catastrophic implosion that led to their demise. The immense pressure at the depths where the tragedy occurred would have instantly caused the submersible's hull to disintegrate, rendering any attempts at communication futile.

The fabricated transcript , which surfaced in late June, appeared to feature minute-by-minute conversations laden with technical jargon and accurate descriptions, creating an illusion of authenticity. The document portrayed the Titan's crew in a state of panic as they grappled with hull alarms and ominous cracking sounds before communication abruptly ceased.

One focal point of the phony transcript was the Real Time Hull Health Monitoring system (RTM), a proprietary device designed by OceanGate to assess the integrity of the submersible's hull during dives. The fictitious communications detailed multiple hull alarms and crackling sounds, culminating in an ominous message indicating an ""RTM alert active all red.""

Former Navy submariner and submersible pilot, Dr Alfred S McLaren, initially found the transcript plausible but later speculated that it may have been concocted to tarnish OceanGate's reputation or inflict further distress upon the families of the victims.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Then create a secure username and password to access the online service.Next, make a list of all your assets. Include property, investments, bank accounts, insurance policies, and any valuable items you own.Decide who will inherit your assets by choosing your beneficiaries.

Your phone number may come at a cost as Trai mulls fee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/your-phone-number-may-come-at-a-cost-as-trai-mulls-fee/articleshow/110952275.cms,"Phone number not infinite resource: TRAI

NEW DELHI: Your phone operator may soon charge a fee for the number of your smartphone and the landline if a proposal by telecom regulator Trai gets implemented. Trai feels that phone number ""represents an exceedingly valuable public resource which is not infinite"" and charges may be imposed on mobile operators, who may subsequently recover them from users.It is also considering whether to impose penalties on operators, who are holding on to number resources with low utilisation. For example, a subscriber with dual SIMs not using one for a long time but the operator is not cancelling this number in fear of losing user base.""...Simply adhering to strict criteria for assigning numbering resources might not ensure judicious and efficient use of freely allotted numbering resources by service providers. One way of ensuring judicious and efficient use of any finite public resource is by imposing charges, while allocating it. Efficient utilisation can be further ensured by introducing penal provision for those holding numbering resources with low utilisation.""Trai said just like spectrum, ownership of the numbering space resides with govt, which only grants mobile operators usage rights over the designated number resource during the tenure of licences. The new Telecom Law, which was passed in December last year, also has an enabling provision to charge for numbers, technically known as 'telecom identifiers'.To make a stronger case for fixing a charge on mobile operators, Trai cited several countries where a fee is levied for telephone numbers, either on the mobile operator or on subscribers. These include countries such as Australia, Singapore, Belgium, Finland, the UK, Lithuania, Greece, Hongkong, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland, Nigeria, South Africa, and Denmark.Talking about the possible methods of charging, Trai said govt can look at either imposing a one-time charge per number, or seek an annual recurring charge for each numbering resource allocated to the service provider, or allocate numbering series, with govt conducting centralised auctions for the vanity numbers.Trai, which has to submit recommendations to govt that will also cover the aspect of ever-shrinking numbering resources in the era of 5G, machine-to-machine communications and internet of things, is also taking a leaf out of the several auctions that mobile operators carry out for 'vanity/fancy/premium numbers'.","Trai feels that phone number ""represents an exceedingly valuable public resource which is not infinite"" It is also considering whether to impose penalties on operators, who are holding on to number resources with low utilisation.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

"Pakistan installs 'China-like internet firewall' to regulate Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and other social media platforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pakistan-installs-china-like-internet-firewall-to-regulate-facebook-whatsapp-youtube-and-other-social-media-platforms/articleshow/110948337.cms,"What is internet firewall in Pakistan aims to do

Pakistan is implementing a nationwide internet firewall system to monitor and regulate content on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and X (formerly Twitter), according to sources reported to be close to the development. Some say the internet firewall is akin to something that China has to monitor internet content in the country. This move follows the temporary blocking of X in Pakistan earlier this year. The stated goal is said to be to curb the spread of ""undesirable content,"" which includes propaganda and content deemed offensive by the Pakistani government.Pakistan's justification for blocking X centered on the platform's non-compliance with Pakistani laws and its alleged failure to register within the country. The government maintains that these actions do not violate fundamental rights.* Identify Propaganda: The firewall will reportedly use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology to examine data packets and identify sources of propaganda material. DPI can inspect data up to the application layer, allowing for a more granular analysis of content.* Keyword Filtering: A key feature of the system is Keyword filtering is a key feature of the system. This aims to identify and block content deemed undesirable by the government, potentially including blasphemy, hate speech, or content critical of the state.* Limit VPN Use: The Pakistani government is also looking to regulate the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) which some users have employed to bypass restrictions on X. Initial attempts to restrict VPNs faced resistance from businesses, leading to a temporary suspension of those efforts.The temporary blocking of X in Pakistan has significantly reduced its user base in the country. The number of users dropped from 4.5 million to 2.4 million. This suggests that the government's actions can be effective in limiting access to certain platforms. Additionally, X's management appears to be more responsive to Pakistani government requests to take down content deemed problematic.","Pakistan is implementing a nationwide internet firewall system to monitor and regulate content on social media platforms.

Google Meet add-ons on Android: How it will work



Google has announced that Meet add-ons will now be available on Android phones and tablets. The tech giant added this feature to the web version of the video conferencing platform which will allow users to install and use third and first-party apps directly from within the Meet app.In a blog post, the company confirmed that Google Meet add-ons on Android will be available to all Google Workspace customers .However, it will take up to two weeks to reach all users the company noted. Moreover, Google also said that “Scheduled Release domains” won’t get this feature until June 24-27.Android users will be able to find Meet add-ons in the Activities panel . This feature can be found along with features like polls and Q&A. However, it's important to note that desktop add-ons that won’t be available on mobile will be categorised as “Unavailable.”Google said that the visibility of all add-ons will be controlled by a dedicated setting, which will have separate toggles for the visibility of first-party and featured third-party add-ons.The company also confirmed that admins will be able to review their configuration by heading to Settings> Google Workspace>Apps in Google Meet’s video settings.It’s also important to note that the setting will handle add-on availability for both the desktop and Android apps.

What makes the Apple Password app important

The rumors turned out to be true. Apple is finally launching a dedicated password manager app called Passwords. This app will be integrated across various Apple operating systems, including: iOS 18, MacOS Sequoia (the next major macOS version) and iPadOS (specific version not mentioned).Interestingly, the Passwords app will also be accessible on Windows through iCloud, allowing users to manage their passwords even on non-Apple devices. This is a significant move for Apple, considering the current reliance on third-party password managers like LastPass and 1Password . The new Passwords app will directly compete with established password management services like LastPass and 1Password.* Built on iCloud Keychain: The app leverages the existing iCloud Keychain technology, which already stores passwords on Apple devices.* Organization and Categorization: Passwords will be listed and categorized based on service type (e.g., banking, social media) for easier management.* Security and Convenience: The app will support secure logins through Face ID, Touch ID, and autofill features, eliminating the need to manually type passwords.While Apple offered password storage within Settings, it wasn't a dedicated app and lacked the features likely present in Passwords. This app seems particularly appealing for users heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.Apple hasn't revealed if the Passwords app will be free or require a subscription. Overall, Apple's Passwords app presents a strong alternative to existing password managers, especially for Apple users. With its integration across various platforms and potential ease of use, Passwords could become a popular choice for managing login credentials securely.","Apple is launching a dedicated password manager app called Passwords.
