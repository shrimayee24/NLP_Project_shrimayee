Who is Amouranth? Internet sensation makes a Twitch comeback after $38 million profit on Kick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/who-is-amouranth-internet-sensation-makes-a-twitch-comeback-after-38-million-profit-on-kick/articleshow/122002691.cms,"Amouranth’s rise to internet fame: From cosplay to controversy



The Kick deal that changed everything

Why she is returning to Twitch now



No YouTube comeback expected

A top name in online entertainment



Kaitlyn Siragusa , better known as Amouranth, a viral internet personality and streamer who has made her highly anticipated return to Twitch on June 20, 2025. Over the past two years, she earned a staggering $38 million on rival streaming platform Kick , becoming one of the most financially successful figures in online entertainment. Known for her bold mix of gaming, cosplay , ASMR, and real-life streams, Amouranth originally built her empire on Twitch before facing multiple bans and moving to other platforms. Her return signals both a personal comeback and a potential shift in the ongoing competition between streaming giants.Her return to Twitch not only marks a personal comeback but also highlights the evolving dynamics of the streaming industry. With platforms like Kick scaling back exclusivity deals and encouraging multistreaming, Amouranth’s move could signal a new era where top creators leverage multiple platforms on their own terms. While her relationship with YouTube remains strained, Twitch’s massive audience and cultural influence make it the ideal stage for her to continue growing her brand.Amouranth began her career as a cosplayer and model before joining Twitch in 2016, where she quickly gained massive popularity. Her streams combined gaming, audience interaction, and ASMR, attracting millions of viewers. She became especially known for her “hot tub” streams, a controversial Twitch subgenre that sparked widespread discussion. Despite facing repeated bans for pushing Twitch’s content boundaries, Amouranth remained a fan favorite and expanded her influence through various business ventures, including OnlyFans and merchandise. Her ability to adapt and innovate helped her become one of Twitch’s most successful and recognizable creators.In 2023, following xQc’s headline-making $100 million deal with Kick, Amouranth joined the platform backed by crypto gambling site Stake. Though the details of her contract were not publicly disclosed, she confirmed that her income more than doubled compared to Twitch. Over two years, she reportedly made $38 million through Kick deals, merchandise sales, and content subscriptions.On June 19, 2025, Amouranth shared a playful teaser video on X (formerly Twitter) hinting at her comeback. In the video, she is seen refueling a green car with a Kick license plate before driving off in a purple vehicle — Twitch’s signature color. A cartoon screen flashes “$38 million later.” While it is not yet confirmed if she will stream exclusively on Twitch, her return has already stirred excitement among fans.Amouranth’s YouTube presence has declined sharply. Her main channel was banned for ban evasion, and her ASMR channel was removed for guideline violations. Given this history, she is not expected to include YouTube in her future content plans.Even during her Kick run, Amouranth remained a widely recognized figure. She launched products, signed brand deals, and continued to grow her online presence. Her return to Twitch highlights her ongoing relevance and reflects the increasing competition among platforms to attract big names. As one of the most followed streamers in the world, Amouranth is poised to remain a dominant force in digital entertainment.","Kaitlyn Siragusa, better known as Amouranth, will return to Twitch on June 20, 2025.

GitHub CEO to software engineers: ‘Key for winning’ AI coding tools is in ….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/github-ceo-to-software-developers-key-for-winning-ai-coding-tools-is-in-/articleshow/121991206.cms,"Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub

Poll Do you believe that manual coding skills are essential even with the rise of AI coding tools? No, AI can do it all Yes, absolutely

Startups can't rely on ""vibe coding"" alone

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the ""key for winning"" with AI coding tools is maintaining the ability to quickly modify AI-generated code manually, rather than relying entirely on automated agents. Speaking on ""The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,"" Thomas Dohmke emphasized that developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.The CEO outlined an ideal workflow where AI agents can write code and submit pull requests, but developers retain the ability to make rapid changes using their existing programming skills . This approach prevents the productivity trap of spending minutes describing simple changes in natural language when the same task could be completed in seconds through direct coding.""The worst alternative is trying to figure out how to provide feedback or prompt to describe in natural language what I already know how to do in programming language,"" Thomas Dohmke explained. Such scenarios could transform three-second tasks into three-minute ordeals, ultimately reducing rather than enhancing productivity.Thomas Dohmke also addressed the trending "" vibe coding "" phenomenon, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe heavy reliance on AI for code generation. During a recent Q&A at Station F in Paris, the GitHub CEO cautioned that startups cannot scale on vibe coding alone.Non-technical founders will struggle to build sustainable companies without skilled developers, he argued, noting they ""can't build a complex system to justify the next round."" The key is enabling developers to choose the best approach for each situation, whether that's leveraging AI agents for maximum ROI or handling tasks directly themselves.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.

In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Her mother Melinda Gates , who Phoebe calls her “rock,” told her she had to raise the capital on her own. “She saw it as a real opportunity for me to, like, learn and fail,” she said.Talking further about Phoebe Gates said that among all her children, she is “the most different than I am"".

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

Read: Amazon CEO's full address to employees

Today, in virtually every corner of the company, we're using Generative AI to make customers lives better and easier. What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we've only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality. Technologies like Generative AI are rare; they come about once-in-a-lifetime, and completely change what's possible for customers and businesses. So, we are investing quite expansively, and, the progress we are making is evident.

You can see it in what we're rolling out in Alexa+, our next generation

Alexa

personal assistant that's meaningfully smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant that can take significant actions for customers on top of providing intelligent answers to virtually any question.

You can see it with our AI shopping assistant that's being used by tens of millions of customers around the world to discover new products and make more informed purchase decisions.

You can see it in an increasing array of shopping features like ""Lens"" (very cool to be able to take a picture of an item and have it pull up the shopping result), ""Buy for Me"" (where I can ask our shopping agent to buy an item on another merchant's website for me), or Recommended Size (where we can predict the right size for you based on prior purchases and how different apparel brands run fit-wise relative to each other).

You can see it in how we're helping our independent sellers more easily create new product detail pages or get advice on how to be even more effective as a seller in our marketplace. Nearly half a million selling partners are using these services, and the listings they're creating are measurably better.

You can see it in Advertising where we've built a suite of AI tools that make it easier for brands to plan, onboard, create and optimize campaigns. In Q1 alone, over 50K advertisers used these capabilities.

And, you can see it in what we're delivering in AWS for builders, whether it's custom silicon (Trainium2) to provide better price-performance on model-training and inference, services that make it much easier to build Foundation Models (SageMaker), or leverage leading frontier models and do GenAI inference at scale (Bedrock), our own frontier model (Nova) to give customers leading intelligence at lower latency and cost, or services to make it much easier for developers to write code (Q and QCLI).

We're also using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations. In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots—all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed. We've rebuilt our Customer Service Chatbot with GenAI, providing an even better experience than we'd had before. And, we're assembling more intelligent and compelling product detail pages from leveraging GenAI.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

While we've made a lot of progress, we're still at the relative beginning. There are a few reasons we believe this and want to go even faster.

First, we have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live. Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast.

Second, and what makes this agentic future so compelling for Amazon, is that these agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers. Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point. We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones. Agents will be teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work, and that will get wiser and more helpful with more experience. If we build and leverage the right agents, it's going to rapidly accelerate our ability to make customers lives easier and better every day, and it's going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.

And third, we're going to keep pushing to operate like the world's largest start-up-- customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all. You will continue to see steam and I take actions to help us move faster, have more ownership, and invent more easily. AI will be a substantial catalyst here.

Today, we have over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but at our scale, that's a small fraction of what we will ultimately build. We're going to lean in further in the coming months. We're going to make it much easier to build agents, and then build (or partner) on several new agents across all of our business units and G&A areas.

As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team's brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams. When I first started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, I worked on leaner teams that got a lot done quickly and where I could have substantial impact. We didn't have tools resembling anything like Generative AI, but we had broad remits, high ambition, and saw the opportunity to improve (and invent) so many customer experiences. Fast forward 28 years and the most transformative technology since the Internet is here. Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.

There's so much more to come with Generative AI. I'm energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what's possible for our customers, partners, and how we work.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy delivered a stark warning to his 1.5 million employees this week, telling them that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the company's workforce in the coming years. In a company-wide memo, Jassy announced that AI agents and generative AI systems will reduce the need for human workers in many current roles.""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in the June 17 memo, adding that the company expects this transformation ""will reduce our total corporate workforce"" within the next few years. The announcement affects Amazon's 350,000 corporate employees working in software engineering, marketing, and other white-collar positions.Jassy painted a future dominated by AI agents, autonomous software systems that can perform complex tasks like research, coding, and automation.

Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy faced flak for his recent observation on how trades will soon become the most coveted professions as ChatGPT would not be fitting pipes or replacing roof tiles.

US tech workers started demanding the end of the H-1B programs so that Americans do not lose their jobs to their foreign counterparts.In December 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy championed a reform of H-1B programs and argued that US companies need to hire from foreign countries as US culture encourages mediocracy and therefore is not producing top talent.Now, with his argument that Americans are losing white collar jobs to ChatGPT, social media users pointed out that another option to save jobs for Americans is to end the H-1B program. ""Sounds like you're familiar with my consistent view that it's a deeply flawed program that needs to be fixed or gutted,"" Ramaswamy replied to one user.Social media users asked whether by 'fixed' he meant more Indians in the system.When Ramaswamy ran for president, he said he would ""gut"" the system for H-1B worker visas if he won the White House.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Why Apple founder Steve Jobs believed teams should ‘argue’ and ‘fight’: ‘That’s what it’s…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-apple-founder-steve-jobs-believed-teams-should-argue-and-fight-thats-what-its/articleshow/122028130.cms,"Steve Jobs’ work habit shared by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos

JOB SCAM ALERT! Don't Let Fake Recruiters Steal Your Money

Apple founder Steve Jobs once said that building great teams requires friction – the one that leads to arguments and strong opinions, but resulting in better ideas and stronger people. In a 1995 interview with PBS’s Triumph of the Nerds, Jobs recalled a story from his childhood when a neighbor showed him how a rock tumbler worked. He told interviewer Bob Cringely that a widower neighbor showed him a homemade tumbler consisting of “a motor”, “coffee can” and a “little band between them”. It was filled with ""regular old ugly rocks,"" water and grit, Jobs told the interviewer, recalling that the stones emerged ""amazingly beautiful"" after a night of clattering. “That’s what it’s like when you get a bunch of incredibly talented people working together,” Jobs said.““They bump up against each other, they make some noise, they make some mistakes, they have arguments sometimes, they fight — but they polish each other,” he added. Jobs believed that real progress comes when people are forced to challenge each other, not just agree.At the time of the interview, he was running NeXT and was preparing to return to Apple.Former Apple employees, as per a Benzinga report, say Jobs often structured team spaces to encourage such interaction. Engineers and designers were placed close together so they had to confront issues head-on. Similar methods were used later in iPhone development and at Pixar, where open criticism in story sessions was part of the creative process.Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter recently said that Steve Jobs would reportedly call colleagues at hours. As per a recent CNBC report, Docter told Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies Gala that Jobs would phone colleagues “at any time, day or night, three in the morning … you're on vacation, doesn't matter”. He further stated that Jobs’ after-hours calls were non-negotiable and that the intensity often ignored personal boundaries. Docter’s comments come amid ongoing discussions about tech’s always-on work culture. He positioned his own leadership style as a contrast to that of Jobs — and to the hustle culture promoted by figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos","Steve Jobs once said that building great teams requires friction – the one that leads to arguments and strong opinions, but resulting in better ideas and stronger people.

Celtics’ Financial Situation Opens Trade Possibility

Rovenchuk notes:

Jaylen Brown’s Strengths That Fit the Los Angeles Lakers

Would This Trade Make Sense for the Lakers?

Thecould make a blockbuster move this offseason by parting ways with Austin Reaves to acquire Boston Celtics superstar. With new ownership taking over, the franchise is expected to explore bold roster changes to strengthen their championship aspirations.According to Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk, the Celtics ’ financial situation under new ownership could force them to shed salary, making Brown a potential trade target.“Continuing to monitor the developments from the Boston Celtics will be an important task for (Rob) Pelinka this summer,” Rovenchuk wrote. “Similarly to the Lakers, the Celtics just got a new ownership group. Unlike the Lakers, that regime is looking to shed costs.” (H/t: Sporting News)- Proven playoff performer (2024 NBA Finals MVP)- Elite two-way player (scoring and defense)- Fits the Lakers' win-now timeline better than ReavesWhile Reaves is a solid playmaker, Brown’s experience and defensive prowess could give the Lakers the edge they need.Boston’s offseason plans have shifted after Jayson Tatum’s Achilles injury, which derailed their title hopes. With the new ownership aiming to reduce costs, key players like Brown, Derrick White, and Kristaps Porzingis could be available.- Brown and White are the most realistic trade targets- Brown’s $285 million contract may require salary adjustments- Lakers could offer Reaves plus draft assets to facilitate the deal- Elite perimeter defender- Reliable scorer in clutch moments- Experience as a secondary star (played Robin to Tatum)- Played through a meniscus injury, showing toughnessWhile Reaves has been a fan favorite, Brown’s resume speaks for itself:- 4x All-Star- NBA Finals MVP- Championship experienceThe Los Angeles Lakers need another star to compete in the loaded Western Conference, and Jaylen Brown could be the missing piece.However, his inconsistent three-point shooting and high salary are factors to consider.If the Celtics are open to negotiations, the Lakers should seriously consider this move. Brown’s two-way impact could elevate them back into title contention, even if it means saying goodbye to Reaves.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Chicago Bulls predicted to land $60 million Boston Celtics star in blockbuster deal for Brandon Clarke and more What do you think—should the Lakers pull the trigger on this trade?","The Los Angeles Lakers could make a blockbuster move this offseason by parting ways with Austin Reaves to acquire Boston Celtics superstar Jaylen Brown.

Legal experts warn Hockey Canada sex assault trial could trigger rushed consent law changes that damage Canada's justice system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/legal-experts-warn-hockey-canada-sex-assault-trial-could-trigger-rushed-consent-law-changes-that-damage-canadas-justice-system/articleshow/122026053.cms,"The Hockey Canada sexual assault trial's conclusion has ignited debate over Canada's legal handling of such cases (Getty Images)

Legal experts divided as Hockey Canada trial stirs fear of another wave of rushed sexual assault law reforms

The high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault trial has reignited fierce debate over how Canada's legal system handles sexual assault cases—and whether another wave of rushed legislative change is looming. Following public uproar after Jian Ghomeshi’s acquittal in 2016, Parliament passed Bill C-51, introducing major Criminal Code reforms. These measures, praised by advocates for preventing “trial by ambush,” forced defence lawyers to disclose communications like emails and texts with complainants before trial.The so-called “Ghomeshi rules” have drawn sharp criticism from criminal defence lawyers, who argue the changes tilt the system unfairly. Now, many legal experts fear that if the accused ex-hockey players are acquitted, lawmakers may rush to make further reforms—this time targeting the already sensitive definition of consent.Lisa Kelly, associate professor of law at Queen’s University, cautions against “reactive lawmaking,” warning it can have unintended effects. “Many would be concerned or very troubled if some or all of the players were acquitted,” she said, drawing parallels to the reaction after Ghomeshi’s verdict.University of Ottawa law professor Daphne Gilbert supports the reforms, saying they add necessary protections. “It prevents trial by ambush, which we really shouldn’t be having in Canada,” she explained. The process now lets complainants hire legal counsel and argue against potentially prejudicial evidence.Yet defence lawyers like Sarah Leamon argue the process undercuts a key strategy. “That element of surprise is undermined,” she said. Others, like Nick Cake, add that disclosing defence communications and filing affidavits opens defendants to cross-examination, effectively stripping them of the right to remain silent.Even supporters of the reform admit the process creates delays. Lisa Dufraimont, a professor at Osgoode Hall, says courts now struggle to manage timelines, as sexual assault trials often involve thousands of text messages and intricate vetting procedures.Also Read: Hockey Canada scandal: How police errors nearly buried and delayed the sexual assault case With the trial of the five former world junior players—Dillon Dubé, Alex Formenton, Carter Hart, Cal Foote, and Michael McLeod—now concluded and a verdict due July 24, many in the legal community worry what comes next.

Ryan Reaves and Paul Bissonnette's stats compared

Fans react to the bathtub roast with laughter

In an unexpected but hilarious moment, Ryan Reaves became the star of a viral video that blended product placement and a well-timed jab. The clip, released Sunday on Reaves’ Instagram, opens with the enforcer lounging in a bubble bath. A text from Paul Bissonnette arrives, poking fun at Reaves’ golf skills. What followed was a tech-assisted response that stole the spotlight.Using Samsung’s new Galaxy 25 Ultra voice command feature, Reaves asked the AI to pull up Bissonnette’s career NHL stats. When it revealed just 7 goals and 22 points, Reaves instructed the phone to write a “scathing response.” Though lighthearted in delivery, the message struck with precision and wit, allowing fans to enjoy a rare moment of player banter executed with perfect comedic timing.While both players filled enforcer roles during their NHL careers, the numbers tell a different story. Reaves has suited up for over 900 games, tallying 63 goals and 137 points. Bissonnette, by contrast, played just 202 games and finished with 22 points.The stark contrast made Reaves’ roast more than just a casual chirp; a career of consistent presence on the ice backed it. Fans were quick to react, pointing out that Reaves not only backed his talk but did so in a way that was entertaining, on-brand, and undeniably accurate.The video went viral across hockey and pop culture pages on Sunday, garnering thousands of views and a wave of memes, reactions, and reposts. The casual tone, the luxurious bubble bath setting, and the surprising punchline made it an instant hit.Whether or not Paul Bissonnette fires back, Ryan Reaves has already won the first round in this off-season chirping match. The blend of stats, tech, and swagger gave fans exactly what they didn’t know they needed: an NHL roast session from a bathtub.Also Read: “Thanks for Bennett and Tkachuk”: Brad Marchand trolls Calgary Flames after the Florida Panthers win Cup again","Ryan Reaves and Paul Bissonnette roast each other in a bathtub.

David Pastrnak’s presence fuels speculation on captaincy



Jersey leak from March hints at new design drop

All signs point to big changes ahead in Boston

On Sunday night, the Boston Bruins dropped an eight-second teaser that sent fans into overdrive. In the short clip, forward David Pastrnak appears, looming above the camera before reaching down to grab what seems to be a jersey. The video cuts before revealing more, ending with a clear onscreen date, 6.25.25; setting up a mysterious midweek announcement.The decision to feature David Pastrnak so prominently has not gone unnoticed. Pastrnak is not only the Bruins’ top offensive weapon but also the face of the franchise. With Brad Marchand having been traded to the Florida Panthers at the deadline, the captaincy is currently vacant.Some fans now believe the team may be signaling that Pastrnak is set to become the next Bruins captain. A new jersey could be more than just a redesign, it could carry the symbolic “C” on his chest, marking a new era of leadership in Boston. Given Pastrnak’s stature and influence, it wouldn’t be surprising if the announcement connects both jersey design and a leadership transition.While the captaincy speculation is strong, there’s also evidence pointing to a jersey reveal. Back in March, reports surfaced about a possible redesign of the Bruins’ jersey for the 2025–26 NHL season.The timing aligns perfectly.Unveiling a new uniform in late June gives the team ample runway to merchandise and market the gear ahead of the new season. Pastrnak’s jersey grab in the video and the camera cutting out before the jersey is revealed seem too precise to be coincidental. It strongly hints that fans will be getting a first look at Boston’s fresh threads on Wednesday.Whether this week’s announcement is about a new captain, a new jersey, or both, the Boston Bruins are setting the tone for a new chapter. The combination of recent trades, shifting leadership, and carefully timed teasers suggests the franchise is rebranding in more ways than one.Fans won’t have to wait long. With June 25 now circled on the calendar, the hockey world will be watching closely as the Bruins make their next big move.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: the Boston Bruins and New York Islanders eye blockbuster deal ahead of 2025 Draft","The Boston Bruins released an eight-second teaser on Sunday night.

The gaming community is buzzing with comparisons of Death Stranding 2's stunning visuals and the visual fidelity of the GTA 6 trailer. Both games are pushing the limits of what's technically feasible on next-gen consoles, but in very different ways. Death Stranding 2 aims for cinematic realism and realistic characters, while GTA 6 wows with its expansive open world and dynamic city landscapes.Death Stranding 2, based on the Decima engine, has left enthusiasts awestruck with its cinematic vision for world creation. Richly detailed environments, advanced lighting, realistic terrain physics, and emotionally charged characters make it one of the most visually refined games available on the PlayStation 5. The trailer reveals subtleties, such as volumetric fog, natural motion, and high-poly textures, that push its presentation to near-filmic levels.While that was happening, GTA 6 made headlines worldwide with its mind-blowing trailer that included ray-traced lighting, reflective realism, and thick, living worlds. Rockstar Games' capability to build a colorful open world filled with interactivity, without ever sacrificing visuals, has become the new benchmark for open-world game development.Online forums and technology commentators have entered the fray. Some supporters claim that Death Stranding 2 beats GTA 6 in sheer fidelity and cinematic finish, particularly in rendering characters. Others are convinced that GTA 6 is due more praise, given the challenge of generating a seamless, gigantic open world that sustains that amount of visual detail.One Reddit user wrote,Both games are aiming for different levels of expression. Both will be graphical power houses but one going to tackle life and the other is going to tackle death. They must convey what they must to achieved their desired goals. There is absolutely no games that look like death stranding or GTA because they both have their own visual style and language.While Death Stranding 2 is best at delivering immersive storytelling and realistic visuals in concentrated environments, GTA 6 leads the way in technical prowess at creating a dynamic and enormous game world. Both games emphasize different strengths, but between them, they represent the pinnacle of what next-gen hardware is capable of producing. No matter if you prefer cinematic depth or open-world immersion, both games are pushing the boundaries of what gamers can look forward to in visual design.Also Read: GTA 6 fan claims Rockstar used his likeness for Jason's character","The gaming community is buzzing with comparisons of Death Stranding 2's stunning visuals and the visual fidelity of the GTA 6 trailer.

Rockstar has always been the king of open-world chaos, but even legends can learn a thing or two.

From hacking the city to social profiling, here are 5 gameplay systems GTA 6 should totally steal fromlet players control traffic lights, blackout entire city blocks, and hijack enemy tech — all with a single button press. Imagine doing that in Vice City. Picture this: You’re mid-getaway, you jam comms, crash cop cars by triggering lights, and vanish like a ghost. Total chaos. Total power. Rockstar, make it happen.In, you could scan any random person and get a fun fact about them — from their job to their shady secrets. It made the city feel alive and weirdly personal. GTA 6 could use this for everything: bounty targets, scam victims, or even side quests. We want dirt on people, not just nameless NPCs walking their dog.nailed this. You could fight without ever pulling a trigger — hacking drones, turrets, or distracting enemies via their phones. It made combat feel clever, not just violent. GTA 6 could bring in Lucia’s brains and Jason’s brawn with this combo. Let us hack cameras, disable alarms, or fry someone’s car mid-chase. It's stealthstyle.Watch Dogs didn’t just give you cameras — it made youthem. Enemies could spot you through CCTV, and you had to think before moving. GTA 6 could bring this into its heists. Imagine planning a job where you have to avoid facial recognition or take out a security grid. Suddenly, stealth becomes more than crouching behind crates.In, you could recruit anyone. GTA 6 doesn’t need to go that far, but borrowing the idea of player-driven chaos would be awesome. Let us record music videos with Real Dimez, help Dre’Quan build his brand, or mess up rival gangs using our own mini-crew. It’s emergent storytelling — and that’s the future of open-world games.GTA 6 is already shaping up to be massive. But if Rockstar blendssmart systems into their signature sandbox, we’re talking total domination. We’ve had years of guns and getaway cars. Now give us power in our palms, deeper worlds, and smarter missions. Steal from, Rockstar.

Fan thinks GTA 6's Jason has his scars and facial features

A Twitter user by the name of Drew Spacely has turned viral for accusing Rockstar Games of using his actual-life image, specifically facial scars, of an old mugshot as inspiration for Jason, one of the main characters in GTA 6. Although he is not threatening to sue, Spacely's side-by-side comparisons and sympathetic tweets have raised eyebrows among the GTA community.Drew Spacely has tweeted a number of times commenting on how visually similar to his character is the characterthat appears in the GTA 6 trailers. He brought attention to distinctive facial scars above his eyebrow and on his jawline, those he asserts are identical to the ones shown on Jason in Rockstar's promotional posters and gameplay videos.Within a single tweet, he posted,along with a collage of his own picture and pictures from the trailer with red circles surrounding similar marks. He further added,Despite all that, Drew was adamant that he does not bear any ill feelings toward Rockstar. In an even newer post, he stated, ""I also just want to announce right now that I will not be seeking any sort of money or legal action against Rockstar Games.I love this company and everything they do.""The wider GTA community is responding with interest and speculation, but Rockstar Games has yet to comment on Spacely's allegations. While there are fans who observe the similarity, others perceive it as a coincidence, as the character's appearance could be a representation of typical archetypes.This is not the first time Rockstar has encountered likeness claims. Late in 2023, theclaimed that his tattooed mugshot had inspired a GTA 6 NPC. Years previously, Lindsay Lohan's claim against Rockstar over a GTA V character was eventually dismissed by the courts.Though there's no official report connecting Drew Spacely to GTA 6's Jason, his assertions have raised fans' interest. Whether coincidence or tacit influence, Drew has explicitly stated he's just a huge fan thrilled about the game.

global takeover

Rockstar Games hasn’t dropped a mainline GTA in over a decade. Since then, the gaming industry has evolved massively, and the pressure to deliver something iconic has never been higher. But judging by everything we do know from leaked details to that record-breaking trailer, GTA 6 might not just be big. It might be Rockstar’s biggest game of all time. Here’s why this might be the GOAT of all Rockstar games.We're going back to(a.k.a. modern-day Florida), and Vice City is the heart of it. But this isn’t the 2002 neon nostalgia trip. We’re getting highways, swamps, suburbs, and cities thatalive. It’s not just a map — it’s an ecosystem. Gators in the streets, yacht parties, and high-speed boat chases through the Keys.Even from that one trailer, the visual quality is. The lighting, the reflections, the— it looks like a living, breathing world. TikTok detectives spotted background NPCs doing everything from scrolling phones to getting in fights. If that level of detail runs in real-time? Yeah, we’re not touching grass for weeks.GTA V came out in 2013. That’s two console generations ago. Since then, Rockstar launched, which completely made the fans go crazy with superb storytelling in an open-world game. If GTA 6 builds on that same level of polish, but adds fast cars, heists, and chaos? It’s going to be the biggest entertainment drop since... ever.Rockstar has had more than 10 years of watching how players interact with GTA Online, what works, what flops, and what keeps us grinding. Expect all of that knowledge to be poured into GTA 6’s online mode, likely launching after the main game. If done right, this could become the go-to online playground for the next decade.While GTA 5 was a masterpiece, Rockstar has taken heat in recent years. Think GTA Trilogy remasters, GTA Online’s grind, and the long wait for anything new. GTA 6 feels like a comeback moment. Rockstar knows it needs to earn back trust. No shortcuts. No filler. Just premium, hand-crafted chaos.This time, it’s not about three unhinged criminals doing chaos for chaos’ sake. Lucia and Jason feel grounded. They're Bonnie & Clyde, but with depth. The trailer already showed their chemistry, and players areshipping them. Rockstar's leaning into character-driven storytelling, and if they pull it off? It’s gonna hit different.GTA 6 is shaping up to be more than a game. It’s an event. And if Rockstar delivers on even half the things fans are hoping for… we're looking at a","GTA 6 is shaping up to be more than a game. It’s an event.

Turkish gamers spearhead a collective call for subtitles in GTA 6

""As Turkish gamers, we have added GTA 6 to our wishlist and are waiting with great excitement. Our only request is to play this game in our own language. Please consider and consider the idea of Turkish localization. We, the gamers, care about you, we are excited. We want to fully understand the story in the GTA 6 experience, we want to have fun. We want Turkish subtitles, please consider.""

No word from Rockstar yet, but fingers crossed

With all the hype around Grand Theft Auto 6 gathering steams across the globe, Turkish gamers are making one thing very clear and loud: Turkish language support, in the form of subtitles. Going by the hashtag, the fans are conducting a mass campaign to get Rockstar Games to localize the game for the Turkish-speaking community. With social media, memes, and direct pleas, the fans are praying they will be heard before the game is released.Turkish players are merely requesting subtitles, not voice dubbing, as a means to comprehend and appreciate the game's story and humor. The movement, which was seen throughout platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and YouTube, has picked up steam with backing coming from influencers and gaming content creators in the country.One recent tweet captured the mood:It has been repeated extensively and even targeted towards Rockstar's official handles, and it cannot be ignored.The campaign is built upon years of frustration, as past Rockstar games, GTA V, GTA IV, and Red Dead Redemption 2 did not support Turkish languages, making a large majority of the fanbase unable to truly enjoy the story.To date, Rockstar Games has not made any public announcement on Turkish localization for GTA 6. The developer tends to self-localize and is hiring experts for the game, but it is not known what languages are being prioritized.Others have theorized that Turkey's absence from earlier games may be due to revenue or piracy issues, but these have not yet been confirmed. The Turkish community, however, feels there is a potential untapped, not only in Turkey but among the Turkish-speaking communities found in Azerbaijan as well.With GTA 6 coming soon, Turkish fans are making their voices heard and clear. With an organized campaign and increasing popularity, they are hoping Rockstar would take notice of their passion and add Turkish subtitles. Whether or not Rockstar does anything about it, the movement has already proven that grassroots efforts can make a difference in deciding the gaming future.Also Read: Leaked GTA Online zombie mode set on Cayo Perico could be Rockstar’s wildest yet","Turkish gamers spearhead a collective call for subtitles in GTA 6.

Can you use a third-party charger for your Nintendo Switch 2?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/can-you-use-a-third-party-charger-for-your-nintendo-switch-2/articleshow/122031179.cms,"Image via Nintendo.

Nintendo Switch 2: Can you use a third-party charger to use your device?

Read More:

As it was expected, Nintendo Switch 2 has absolutely rocked the console market after its release on June 5, 2025. As per the official Nintendo reports, over 3.5 millions of units were sold in just a few days after the release of this highly awaited hybrid console.With new features like GameChat and Joy-Con 2 Controllers, players don’t seem to be leaving their favorite console behind for a second. However, for that your device needs continuous juice. But should you use a third-party charger for that?There has been no official disclaimer from Nintendo about using any third-party charger for the Switch 2 as long as it meets the specific requirements: USB-C Power Delivery (PD) with 60 W of power (20V @3A). However, fans across the community are facing some issues while using different chargers other than the original one. Recently a Reddit user named UhhBirb shared his experience through a post on the official NintendoSwitch subreddit.This user claimed that using a third-party charger can increase the power-consumption by 25% while docked into playing a game (not charging). He then went on to compare the power going into the device with two separate chargers - the original one and a third-party charger.He then concluded that the increased power is lost as heat.He also explained that this power increase might not be harmful for Switch 2 as the dock regulates the voltage, but can damage the dock itself. He also found out that third-party chargers generally charge with low voltage output. At the end, he advised everyone to compare the voltage and wattage output of a third-party charger, because there are many available options out there.So, what’s the answer? Should you use it? Many fans in that post opposed this as they never faced such an issue despite using third-party chargers. However, it is always safe to use the original one, and using it shouldn’t be a problem because it comes in the box and you don’t need to buy it separately.","Nintendo Switch 2 has rocked the console market after its release on June 5, 2025.
