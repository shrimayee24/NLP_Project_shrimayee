Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s post-divorce realities couldn’t be more different

Gisele Bündchen’s motherhood confession offers a rare, unfiltered look at life behind the camera





Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, once one of the most iconic power couples in the world, are now living vastly different post-divorce lives. While Brady seems to be embracing a laid-back, adventure-filled chapter with his daughter Vivian, Gisele is navigating the demanding early stages of motherhood once again — and she’s not sugarcoating it.Tom Brady, who retired from the NFL in 2023, has been making the most of his time off the gridiron. Currently touring Europe, he appears to be diving into different cultures with a humorous twist. On a recent trip to the Netherlands, Brady took to Instagram with a playful confession: “American by birth, Dutch by appetite.” Sharing a photo while indulging in local cuisine, the football legend joked about his temporary shift in loyalty — at least when it comes to food.He also shared a sweet photo with Vivian on a cruise, captioned: “Cruising through life with my favorite co-pilot.” These moments reflect the essence of Brady’s post-retirement priority: quality time with his children. Erin Andrews, Fox Sports anchor and longtime NFL reporter, echoed that sentiment: “Tom always said he wanted to spend more time with his kids once he stepped away from football. He’s really living that now.While Brady travels through Europe, Gisele is living a different reality — one marked by night feeds, exhaustion, and the emotional toll of caring for a newborn. In a candid interview with HOLA! USA and during a photoshoot with Vogue France, the Brazilian supermodel opened up about the difficult balancing act of motherhood and career.“Getting my hair and makeup done feels like I’m on vacation,” she admitted. “With a baby, the nights are so short that I’ve barely brushed my hair in the last few months!” These raw insights struck a chord with many, including parenting expert Dr. Shefali Tsabary, who said, “When someone like Gisele opens up about the physical and emotional toll of parenting a newborn, it humanizes the experience for mothers everywhere. ”Fashion designer Stella McCartney also praised Gisele’s vulnerability, saying, “Motherhood is messy and beautiful—and she’s embracing both.”Also Read: Did Tom Brady regret letting iShowSpeed near his daughter?

Whether it’s cruising through canals or embracing postpartum chaos, both parents are writing new chapters in their own distinct ways — and doing so on their own terms.","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen are living vastly different post-divorce lives.

In a celebration that perfectly bridged the worlds of sports and entertainment, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actress Hailee Steinfeld exchanged vows on May 31, 2025, at the stunning San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California. The picturesque ceremony brought together a unique mix of Hollywood elegance and NFL camaraderie—complete with a surprise guest no one saw coming.While it was no surprise to see several of Allen’s Bills teammates like Mitch Trubisky, Dawson Knox, and Spencer Brown acting as groomsmen, the real buzz came when legendary comedian and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator Larry David made a surprise appearance.David, a noted New York Jets fan—ironically, a division rival of the Bills—caught fans completely off guard. Social media quickly lit up with reactions, including one viral post that read: ""Larry David attending Josh and Hailee's wedding was definitely not on my bingo card but I love it.""Though the presence of a die-hard Jets supporter at a Bills quarterback’s wedding seemed odd at first glance, the connection is rooted in Hailee Steinfeld’s family.

Hailee Steinfeld stunned in a strapless white gown that emphasized classic beauty with modern elegance. Josh Allen, true to his low-key persona off the field, looked sharp in a traditional black tuxedo.

Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury.

Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht.

Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo.

NYT Connections is back with another thrilling puzzle. Struggling with today’s Connections puzzle from The New York Times ? You’re not alone! If today’s grid has you scratching your head, we’ve got the full rundown of hints and answers to help you solve it without losing all your lives. As always, remember: the game only gives you four chances to group the 16 words into four correct categories. Scroll carefully—this article starts with helpful clues and gradually builds to the full solution, so you can decide how much of a nudge you need.Connections is a daily word game from The New York Times where players are challenged to find four groups of four related words from a grid of 16. These connections can be based on meaning, category, wordplay, or even cultural references. The challenge lies in identifying subtle links and avoiding red herrings that seem to fit in multiple categories.Yellow: EasiestGreen: MediumBlue: HarderPurple: Tricky or wordplay-basedScroll slowly to avoid full spoilers.GRANDSTANDPOSTURESHOWBOATSWAGGERFINEHUNKY-DORYOKSWELLCHARMFRIENDSHIPIDTENNISLAWMEDICINESELF-CAREWITCHCRAFTThis puzzle mixed straightforward word categories with some tricky associations.The yellow group (ostentation) was built around expressive actions like SHOWBOAT and SWAGGER, with POSTURE and GRANDSTAND rounding it out—though CHARM was an easy red herring here.The green group reflected varying degrees of “things being okay” with FINE, OK, SWELL, and HUNKY-DORY, even if SWELL might seem a bit more positive than just “fine.”The blue category may have stumped some: it included types of bracelets, such as FRIENDSHIP, ID (often used for medical or military tags), and the more obscure TENNIS bracelet—a diamond jewellery item.The final group, purple, brought in the theme of “things you can practice,” like LAW and MEDICINE, but also SELF-CARE and WITCHCRAFT, adding a nice touch of modern and mystical.","Connections is a daily word game from The New York Times.

WWDC 2025: macOS Tahoe name leaked ahead of Apple’s first biggest event of 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wwdc-2025-macos-tahoe-name-leaked-ahead-of-apples-first-biggest-event-of-2025/articleshow/121563066.cms,"Here’s why Apple is naming macOS 26 as macOS Tahoe



What to expect at WWDC 2025

Swift Assist Updates – Enhancements to Apple’s developer tools.

Rich Text Editor for SwiftUI – A new feature aimed at improving app development workflows.

On-Device AI Models for Developers – Apple may allow third-party developers to embed its AI models into apps, though these models are smaller and less powerful than OpenAI’s or Google’s offerings.

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next week. At the event the company is expected to unveil the latest versions of its iOS, iPadOS and macOS operating systems. Now a new report suggests that Apple may name the upcoming version of macOS as macOS Tahoe . As reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple’s upcoming macOS 26 is said to be named macOS Tahoe. The name follows Apple’s tradition of using California landmarks for macOS branding, with Lake Tahoe chosen to represent the new design overhaul expected in this release.Apple traditionally names its macOS operating systems after iconic California landmarks, a practice that has led to names like macOS Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina in recent years. Lake Tahoe, known for its clear waters and mountain reflections, aligns with Apple’s rumoured glass-like, translucent UI redesign. The update is expected to bring more fluid animations, redesigned icons, and a refreshed interface across Apple’s ecosystem. Lake Tahoe, a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, fits this naming convention perfectly.Alongside macOS Tahoe, Apple is reportedly rebranding all its operating systems to match the calendar year. Instead of iOS 19, macOS 15, or watchOS 12, Apple will introduce iOS 26 , macOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, simplifying version numbers for users and developers.Despite the scaled-down nature of the event, Apple will likely introduce:","Apple is set to host its annual developer conference next week.

A Reddit user expressed desire to move back to India after spending 15 years in the US.





While US tech workers are raging against H-1B visa holders for stealing their jobs, a Reddit post of a H-1B visa holder has grabbed the attention as the person sought advice on moving back to India -- after 15 years. The person came to the US as a student and then started working but now after 15 years, the user feels tired of restrictions. The restrictions that come being an H-1B visa holder. ""Can't go anywhere, can't start my business,"" the Reddit post read.""The title and I want to work as a Product Manager. Do you think there will be problem in getting jobs in India?

Now I am tired of the restrictions. Endless H1B stamping cycles. Can’t go anywhere, can’t start my own businesses. I want to explore what India can offer but I also want to work as a Product Manger.

Could you own one?





A simple penny you’ve overlooked could be worth a life-changing amount. One rare 2001-D Lincoln cent has made waves in the numismatic world for an extraordinary reason: a minting error that combines the front of a penny with the back of a dime. This so-called “mule error” coin, produced at the Denver Mint, has sold for over $100,000 at auction. While it looks like an ordinary penny on one side, flipping it over reveals a design never meant to be there. If you have one, even in poor shape, it could still be worth tens of thousands.The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint. While the front (obverse) of the coin features the usual portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the reverse side is where things take a surprising turn: instead of the Lincoln Memorial, it shows the reverse of a Roosevelt dime. This unexpected pairing of obverse and reverse designs is called a ""mule"" error—an accidental blend of two different coins.Only a handful of these coins are known to exist, making them incredibly rare. Experts believe fewer than 10 may have ever entered circulation. Because of this rarity, they’ve become highly valuable in the collector market. Even damaged or worn versions of this coin could sell for $20,000 or more.Four of these rare coins have already made headlines with their auction results:These figures reflect the coin’s growing demand and scarcity, especially among error coin collectors.Because these coins were unintentionally released into circulation, it’s possible—though extremely unlikely—that one could still be found in everyday pocket change. The key is to look for a 2001 penny with a ""D"" mint mark (for Denver) on the front, and then check the reverse. If it shows the torch, olive branch, and oak branch design found on a Roosevelt dime instead of the Lincoln Memorial, you may have something special.While the odds of finding this mint error are slim, it’s a reminder of how even small mistakes can create big value in the world of numismatics. So next time you empty your wallet, take a moment to inspect your coins—you might just be holding a $100,000 treasure.","The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109034604,imgsize-54266,width-400,resizemode-4/109034604.jpg"

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

An open-source software , originally designed for hobbyist drones, powered a recent Ukrainian attack that allegedly destroyed a third of Russia’s strategic long-range bombers, a report has said. The original creators of ArduPilot expressed surprise at the software’s wartime application.According to a report by 404Media, Chris Anderson, one of ArduPilot's founders, commented on LinkedIn below attack footage, ""That's ArduPilot, launched from my basement 18 years ago. Crazy.""On X, Anderson tagged co-creators Jordi Muñoz and Jason Short in a post about the attack. Short replied, ""Not in a million years would I have predicted this outcome. I just wanted to make flying robots.""""Ardupilot powered drones just took out half the Russian strategic bomber fleet,"" he added.ArduPilot, an open-source software system, originated in 2007. Anderson launched DIYdrones.com and assembled an early UAV autopilot using Lego Mindstorms. Two years later, Muñoz won an autonomous vehicle competition using a small helicopter with autopilot. Muñoz and Anderson subsequently founded 3DR, an early consumer drone company, and released initial versions of ArduPilot in 2009.Over the next decade, ArduPilot was refined by its creators and a global community of hobbyist and professional drone pilots. As open-source software, it is free to use and can be modified for various purposes. In this instance, it facilitated a complex series of small drone strikes.The software enables connection to a DIY drone, displays a GPS-linked map, and can control takeoff, flight, and landing. Pilots can set waypoints for autonomous flight.Even without GPS, which Russia jams using its GLONASS system, ArduPilot provides assistive features. These include drone stabilisation, a ""loitering mode"" for temporary halts, and failsafe modes to maintain flight if signal is lost.The ArduPilot project website describes the software as ""a trusted, versatile, and open source autopilot system supporting many vehicle types.""It lists peaceful use cases such as ""search and rescue, submersible ROV, 3D mapping, first person view [flying], and autonomous mowers and tractors.""

The smuggled North Korean smartphone (Source: BBC)

Digital underground fights back in information war

Regime profits from illegal smartphone trade

A smartphone smuggled out of North Korea has exposed the regime's sophisticated digital control system that automatically censors South Korean words, takes secret screenshots every five minutes, and warns users against forbidden language, revealing how Kim Jong Un is gaining ground in an information war against the South.The device, obtained by the BBC through Seoul-based Daily NK, appears identical to standard smartphones but operates as a surveillance tool disguised as consumer technology. When users type "" oppa ,""a South Korean slang term for boyfriend, the phone auto-corrects it to ""comrade"" and displays a warning that the word should only refer to siblings. Similarly, "" South Korea "" automatically changes to ""puppet state,"" reflecting North Korean propaganda.Most disturbing is the phone's covert surveillance feature: it captures screenshots every five minutes and stores them in a secret folder accessible only to authorities, not users. This creates a comprehensive digital record of every user activity for government monitoring.""Smartphones are now part and parcel of the way North Korea tries to indoctrinate people,"" Martyn Williams, a North Korean technology expert at the Stimson Center, told the BBC. He warned that North Korea is ""starting to gain the upper hand"" in the information war.While Kim Jong Un's smartphone surveillance system demonstrates the regime's growing technological sophistication, a small but determined community of North Korean hackers is mounting resistance by jailbreaking government-approved phones. According to a 2022 report by human rights organization Lumen and the Stimson Center, these digital rebels, often educated at elite universities like Kim Il Sung University, use USB connections and Windows PCs to install unauthorized software that bypasses censorship controls.The jailbreakers primarily seek access to forbidden South Korean dramas, K-pop music, and unapproved apps, the very content Kim's smartphone restrictions are designed to block. Some operate commercial services, helping others remove restrictions from their devices. Their activities have prompted new laws specifically targeting ""phone manipulation programs,"" indicating that despite the regime's apparent upper hand in the information war, authorities remain concerned about this underground resistance.North Korea's smartphone industry itself violates international sanctions, generating significant revenue for the regime. An estimated six million North Koreans, a quarter of the population, now own mobile phones, with basic devices costing $100-$400 despite average monthly earnings of just $100.Analysis of North Korean phones by Reuters reveals they contain Taiwanese semiconductors, Chinese batteries, and modified Android operating systems, all imported despite 2017 UN sanctions prohibiting mobile hardware imports. The phones are manufactured by Chinese companies like Gionee using components from MediaTek and Toshiba, though these companies deny direct business with North Korea.This digital infrastructure supports North Korea's informal market economy while providing the regime with unprecedented surveillance capabilities and sanctions-busting revenue streams, demonstrating how authoritarian governments can weaponize consumer technology for social control. As Williams warned, North Korea is ""starting to gain the upper hand"" in the information war.","A smartphone smuggled out of North Korea has exposed the regime's sophisticated digital control system.

Elon Musk has denied a post claiming Tesla collaborated with TikTok influencer Anna Malygon (5.5M followers) to promote the Optimus robot. An X user Ryan's Model Y @ryanjaycowan shared a post that said that the EV maker appears to be working with influencer Anna Malygon, alleging Optimus appeared in her multiple videos. The TikTok influencer has about 5.5 million followers on TikTok.“Tesla appears to be working with influencer Anna Malygon (5.5M followers on TikTok).

But Musk's response suggests the collaboration may be fabricated or unauthorized, aligning with @OwenSparks_'s claim that the images are likely CGI.

On June 1, 2025, Ukraine launched a sweeping drone offensive, codenamed Operation Spiderweb targeting Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers. Over 100 drones struck facilities across Russia, from Murmansk above the Arctic Circle to the Amur region, 8,000 kilometers from Ukraine. The operation, marked by explosions across multiple time zones, underscored the growing role of drones in modern warfare.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, in November 2024, Schmidt urged the U.S. to rethink its military priorities, suggesting it replace traditional tank fleets with advanced drones. “I read somewhere that the U.S. had thousands of tanks stored somewhere. Give them away. Buy a drone instead,” he said, citing Ukraine’s success in using affordable drones to counter Russia’s numerical and air superiority. Schmidt’s advocacy draws from his leadership of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which in 2021 concluded that AI would transform warfare across all domains.The attack highlights a strategic shift advocated by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who has emerged as a key figure in integrating AI-driven technology into military strategy. Schmidt, founder of the military startup White Stork, is developing AI-powered "" Kamikaze drones "" for Ukraine. These drones, designed to loiter and strike targets autonomously, can operate in GPS-denied environments, making them ideal for Ukraine’s battlefield needs. Named after a bird common in Ukraine, White Stork’s drones aim to counter Russian forces by destroying high-value targets like tanks, which Schmidt notes can be neutralized by a $5,000 drone despite costing millions.In a 2023 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schmidt called Kamikaze drones—costing as little as $400 and carrying small explosives—“the most important” innovation for defeating Russia and future adversaries. Ukraine’s recent operation exemplifies this vision, showcasing how drones can strike deep into enemy territory, reshaping the battlefield.Since leaving Google in 2018, where he served as CEO from 2001 to 2011 and later as executive chairman of Alphabet, Schmidt has bridged Silicon Valley and the Pentagon, championing AI-driven defense solutions. His work with White Stork and his public statements signal a broader push for militaries worldwide to embrace autonomous technology as the future of warfare.","Ukraine launched a sweeping drone offensive, codenamed Operation Spiderweb targeting Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers.
